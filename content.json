Suppose $T’=(\\pi’,\\delta)$ is a shortest-paths tree.

I’m gonna talk about the paper “Improved Time …” Slide 2 To introduce the problem, we first define the term “non-decreasing path”. As the name implies, a non-decreasing path is “a path on which …” Now, our goal is to compute the minimum last edge weight of any NDP between all pairs of vertices. Formally, we want to compute a matrix R, whose entry (i,j) equals “the minimum last edge weight …” (or \\infty if there is no such a path) As usual, we’ll use m and n to denote the number of edges and the number of vertices respectively. use w§ to denote the minimum last edge weight of P If consider the weight to be time, then we want to travel from i to j with the earliest arrival time. Slide 3 Ok, here are some related results. The most related problem is “Single Source …” which asks to compute the same thing, but only for a single given source. A folklore modification of the Dijkstra’s algorithms solves it in “” time Then, about a decade ago, this paper by Virginia gave a O(m log log n) time algorithm, which is faster in sparse graph. Besides, this paper also gave a linear time algorithm, but in the word-RAM model of computation. For the APNP problem, the same paper gave “the first …”, which runs in this time, with the exponent (15+w)/6. This result can be directly improved by using a faster sub-routine. (Where \\omega is the exponent of the time for matrix multiplication) Note that the APNP problem is “at least as hard as …” In this paper, we first give a result of “”, and then slightly improve it to “”. The relation of these values can be seen in this graph. Slide 4 In this paper, we first define two matrix products, which are kind of similar to the standard matrix multiplication. The first is the dominance product, which counts the number of dominated entries. Another is the “star” product, which is similar as dominance product, but gives the minimum dominating entry in matrix B. The best known result for the star product is given by this paper with this result. This is the faster subroutine that improves virginia’s APNP algorithm Slide 5 Suppose A is the weight matrix of graph G. It can be seen as the APNP result matrix for restricted NDPs containing exactly one edge of G Then A\\star A corresponds to NDPs containing … And the minimum of them corresponds to … In this example, the entry (1,3) of A\\star A get the value 2, which you can see from the graph: there is path from vertex 1 to 2 and then to 3. Slide 6 Let’s call it the Min-Star operation, which functions as extending one edge. If R corresponds to NDPs … Then the result of the Min-Star operation corresponds to NDPs … So, we can come up a Naive algorithm like this. It just repeats the Min-Star operation (n-1) times. However, it costs more than O(n^3) time. Slide 7 Here we give a different perspective of the Min-Star operation It’s easy to see that in the star product, the entries in k-th column of R are only compared to the entries in k-th row of A So, we can compute the Min-Star operation in a “Scanning” style. Specifically, we use every entry of R to scan its corresponding row in A. It seems that this is even worse since it costs O(n^3) time for each Min-Star operation, which results in O(n^4) time in total. But if we look a little closely, we can see that in the “…” So, if we sort the list of finite entries of each row of A, then we can eliminate “…” Slide 8,9,10 Here is a simple example. We use a matrix N to record the position of scanning. N[i,j] is initialized to the beginning position. Here we use R’ to scan A once and the result matrix is R. We use every finite entry of R’ to scan the corresponding row of A from the position N[i,k]. Whenever an entry is scanned, update R as needed. In this scanning, … Here, we use the scanning entry of value 7 to scan the first row of A When the first entry 12 is scanned, the corresponding entry in R is updated. The the same for the second scanned entry 8 We continue scanning until “…” The key point is that: the next repetition of scanning begins … So, for each entry (i,j), the number of scanned entries in the whole n-1 repetitions of scanning is at most n. Therefore, the total time for n-1 repetition of the Min-star operation is reduced to O(n^3) Slide 11 It’s time to introduce our algorithms. We first divide “…” So each sub-matrix contains … We claim that any NDP is … because of the nature of NDP With only one exception: there may be some edges … We handle this by splitting out those edges into … There are at most L such matrices Then we can extend NDPs from A_l to A’_l by matrix multiplication . Because the weights in A’_l are same, which is w_l, and which is greater than all finite entries in A_l Ok, from now on, we’ll ignore this issue. Slide 12 Here are some useful notations. Note that n_l represents the number of … Note that “new” entries are those entries become finite in R_l We conclude that the sum of all n_l’s is at most n^2 because … Slide 13 The main idea of out algorithm is to compute R_1, R_2, …, R_L one by one At the beginning of each phase, we first perform “one edge extension” by … After this, we get a matrix R_l’, which represents the APNP matrix … Then, we do scanning at most (n-1) times You may ask why we do this two steps, rather than just scan n-1 times. Actually, this is one of the main ideas of our paper. Slide 14 After one edge extension, we only need to use those “new entries to do scanning” because … So our algorithm works like this Slide 15 Generally, the … as mentioned before But there are two observations: first … and second A_l contains … it’s sparse By taking advantage of them, the one edge extension can be computed … First, We use boolean matrix multiplication to … Then we use column-balancing … Slide 16 Ok, now we give a simple case. Under the assumption that each row of A_l … which means that … recall that each G_l contains at most n^2/L Then the scanning time is … Hence the total time is beautiful. It’s optimum in some sense. So, the question is: What if … ? Slide 17 To solve this question, we use a similar method as the APNP algorithm in Virginia’s paper The algorithm in that paper first compute … Then it samples a hitting set S of this amount of vertices and compute all NDPs … The algorithm works because: If an … So we can compute p[i,j] by concatenating two subpaths. One is from i to some vertex in S, whose information can be read directly from R Another subpath is from this vertex in S to j, which needs the following oracle Slide 18 The oracle T(h_1,j) for … The oracle for each h_1 can be … There is a byproduct matrix H_2 which … This matrix will play an important role in our algorithm Slide 19 Here is an example. Note that when w’=2, w’’=4 because … w’’ can be found by binary searching For example, given 1, it outputs 4 given 4, it outputs 7 The size of set S is … and the number of queries is … since we query for each pair i,j and each vertex in S The total time of Virginia’s algorithm is hence this value Slide 20 Now let’s get back to our algorithms. What remains is the question … We handle it using the concatenation method as before. For ease of analysis, we replace the notation L with n^t Then we need to deal with the case when “rows of A_l …” We distinguish two kinds of vertices: … Then we solve the question by these two steps: first scan … , after this, we have examined all NDPs that do not pass any high vertex then examine … Slide 21 We use the same oracle for concatenation The time for computing the oracle is … Each query costs However, a new problem comes up. We can’t afford so many queries Here comes the another main idea of our paper. Slide 22 Fortunately, we can query only … We first split a matrix H_1 from R^L where R^L is … Recall that we’ve got a byproduct when computing the oracle By computing a boolean matrix multiplication We claim that we only need to query … It takes this time by using sparse … Specifically, the query procedure works like this The number of queries is bounded by this value Slide 23 Here is the main framework of our algorithm Each phase consists of three steps: … Slide 24 Here is the total time Slide 25 Now we concatenate n^q+1 paths There are two kinds of paths Slide 26 In each phase, we repeat n^q times of scanning and concatenating Then we’ve computed paths through at most … Slide 27 The time for the star product can be reduced because they are two rectangular matrix. In this time, \\omega(1,k,1) is … Also, note that the scanning time … For paths through more than n^q high vertices, … Slide 28 By reducing rectangular matrix multiplication to matrix multiplication, we have this inequality. And the total time can be improved slightly to n^2.78"},{"title":"Daily","date":"2018-10-10T05:22:50.000Z","updated":"2018-10-10T05:22:50.000Z","comments":true,"path":"default/daily.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/default/daily.html","excerpt":"羽毛球笔记： 上网步伐练习 1. 初始位置永远是右脚稍稍在前，重心下蹲 2. 交叉步两步上网，不要用垫步 3. 第一步判断来球方位，不要出拍;判断好来球方位后第二步要根据击球点来跨（跨远还是跨近），跨步的同时出拍抢最高点 4. 出拍时拍面接近于水平（有一点偏角），拍杆与前臂夹角接近90度，不要呈180度的水平夹角 5. 击球后回退时先退一小步（并步退，保持右脚在前），准备下一拍可能的扑球。然后再退第二步，退的时候注意稍稍压低重心","text":"羽毛球笔记： 上网步伐练习 初始位置永远是右脚稍稍在前，重心下蹲 交叉步两步上网，不要用垫步 第一步判断来球方位，不要出拍;判断好来球方位后第二步要根据击球点来跨（跨远还是跨近），跨步的同时出拍抢最高点 出拍时拍面接近于水平（有一点偏角），拍杆与前臂夹角接近90度，不要呈180度的水平夹角 击球后回退时先退一小步（并步退，保持右脚在前），准备下一拍可能的扑球。然后再退第二步，退的时候注意稍稍压低重心"},{"title":"","date":"2018-10-05T12:18:03.000Z","updated":"2018-10-05T12:18:03.000Z","comments":true,"path":"default/draft.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/default/draft.html","excerpt":"Draft 1 2 string s1 = regex_replace(s,regex(\"\\\\r(\\\\n|\\\\xc2\\\\x85)?|(\\\\xe2\\\\x90\\\\xa4|\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa8|\\\\xc2\\\\x85)\"),\"\\n\"); s1 = regex_replace(s1,regex(\"\\\\x00\"),\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\"); Unicode 尽可能选择utf-8, 当作单字节处理, 不要转成u32, u16. regex_replace 一个utf-8字符可以通过regex_replace 多个\\x字符来完成. 由utf-8的编码规则可知, 任一ASCII中的字符的","text":"Draft 12string s1 = regex_replace(s,regex(\"\\\\r(\\\\n|\\\\xc2\\\\x85)?|(\\\\xe2\\\\x90\\\\xa4|\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\xa8|\\\\xc2\\\\x85)\"),\"\\n\");s1 = regex_replace(s1,regex(\"\\\\x00\"),\"\\xef\\xbf\\xbd\"); Unicode 尽可能选择utf-8, 当作单字节处理, 不要转成u32, u16. regex_replace 一个utf-8字符可以通过regex_replace 多个\\x字符来完成. 由utf-8的编码规则可知, 任一ASCII中的字符的编码都不可能是其它任意字符编码的一部分. 可以说, utf-8编码是prefix, infix, postfix 编码. 因此, 处理utf-8字符时完全可以当作多个单字节来处理. c++中\\u好像只能用在u32string, u16string中, 不能用于utf-8. utf-8可以用\\x. \\x 可以出现在任意字符串中, 但 \\U和\\u只能出现在 u16“”, u32“” 中. utf-8, utf-16, utf-32 对应的c++ type 分别是unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int (int_32) What Every Programmer Absolutely, Positively Needs To Know About Encodings And Character Sets To Work With Text 字符编码笔记：ASCII，Unicode 和 UTF-8 (阮一峰) online converter Javascript I/O Models and event loop in javascript C++ How to create a shared library with cmake?

The movie starts in 5 minutes. 虽然还没有发生，但是由于所描述的事在某种程度上可以视为“确定的事实”，不必加上表示不确定性的助动词。 I’ll be ready when he comes. If you are late again, you’ll be fired. 同时叙述两件未来的事性，而两者之间有时间或条件的关联性时，往往其中一件（副词从句中的那句）要改成现在式。这是因为两件未来的事情都不确定，需要先假定其中一件是事实已经发生，才能去推论另一件事。 条件语气 句子中一旦加上语气助动词（如 must, should, will/would, may/might, can/could 等），就产生了不确定的语气，称为条件语气。有两点需要注意： 表达时间功能的不完整性 语气助动词中，must 和 should 这两个词在拼法上没有变化。至于 will/would, may/might, can/could 这三对虽然拼法有变化，可是并不表示时间，而是语气的变化：每一对的后者比前者更不确定。 语气助动词，不论是must这一类，还是can/could这一类，都无法明确表达过去式。助动词后面要用动词原形，同样缺乏时间变化，所以语气助动词需要寻找另一种特别的方式来表达过去时间。 用完成式表达对过去的猜测 语气助动词用来猜测过去的事情时，因为缺乏表达过去时间的能力，所以要借助完成式来表达。例如： It may rain any minute now. (对现在、未来的猜测) It may have rained a little last night. （对过去的猜测） 假设语气 这是一种“说反话”的语气，表示所说的话和事实相反。这种语气是以动词的过去形态作为表达“非事实”的手段。 现在时间 If I were you, I wouldn’t do it. 假设语气是用动词的过去形态来表示”非事实“，因此用 I were you 来表示。连带在主句中也用过去形态（不代表过去时间）的 would 来表示非事实。 过去时间 If I had known earlier, I might have done something. 句子描述的时间本来就是过去时间，要用过去形态来表示”非事实“，就必须用过去完成形态 had known. 同样，主句中也要用过去完成形态（注意区分过去完成时） might have done. 其中 might 是过去形态， have done 是完成式。 未来时间 If an asteroid should hit the earth, man could die out. 这是未来的事情，严格说起来还不能确定，但是发生的可能性甚低，所以可以用非事实语气来叙述。条件从句中用过去形态但不代表过去式的 should hit 来表示非事实，主句中也是用 could die 来表示非事实。 如果是绝无可能发生的事，还有另一种表达方式： If I were to take the bribe, I could never look at other people in the eye again. 用 be going to 的过去形态 were to 来表示未来也绝不会去做。 如果用的是 should， 语气就比较松动，表示应无发生的可能但不排除万一。 以上三种时间的鸡窝，有些地方值得进一步了解一下： 句型的规律性 因为假设语气的句子是用过去形态来表示非事实，所以动词看起来都是过去形态。从以上例子可以看出，主句中都有过去式的语气助词（would, might, could). 这是因为这些句子都是在表达在一个假定的条件（非事实）下“就会”、“就可能”、“就能“有什么结果（也是非事实），所以假设语气的主句中都会有过去拼法的助动词存在。 在假设语气的条件从句中，表示现在时间和过去时间的都没有助动词存在，这是因为要先把假设的条件当真，不能用表示不确定性的助动词。只有未来时间无法排除不确定性，所以用 should 来表示可能性极小的情况，绝无可能的状况用 were to 来表示。这是条件从句中唯一会见到助动词的地方。 动词的规律性 假设语气的动词都是以过去形态来表示非事实，若是现在时间就退后成过去形态，过去时间也就退后成为过去完成形态，而未来时间则是主从句都用过去拼法的助动词来表示。 混合时间的变化 If I had studied harder in school, I could qualify for the job now. 混合真假的变化 I could have contributed to the fund dirve then, only that I didn’t have any money with me. 句型的变化 假设语气的句型很可能不是规规矩矩的“条件从句＋主句”的形态。例如： It’s time kids were in bed. If only I had more time! 祈使语气 祈使语气可视为是条件语气中，省略助动词来表示“希望能成真，但尚未实现”。例如： Come in! 可视为 You may come in! 的省略。 一般语法书上列出一些规则，如： It is necessary that… I insist that… 这些句型后面要用原形动词。其实这就是一种命令句，所以把它称为“间接命令句”，放在祈使语气中来介绍。"},{"title":"Writing","date":"2018-11-25T13:40:03.000Z","updated":"2018-11-25T13:40:03.000Z","comments":true,"path":"english/writing.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/english/writing.html","excerpt":"To simplify the ensuing presentation, … Had there been that if … In paticular, …","text":"To simplify the ensuing presentation, … Had there been that if … In paticular, …"},{"title":"review paper","date":"2018-07-28T09:58:15.000Z","updated":"2018-07-28T09:58:15.000Z","comments":true,"path":"default/review_paper.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/default/review_paper.html","excerpt":"Review of “On Counting Oracles for Path Problems” ----------- Overall evaluation ----------- This paper presents algorithms for two oracles answering counting queries: the number of (shortest) paths between any pair of vertices.

The first oracle answers the number of paths for a planar DAG; the second answers the number of shortest paths for a planar graph (directed or undirected) with positive edge weights. Both oracles take $O(n^{1.5})$ preprocessing time, $O(n^{1.5})$ space and $O(\\sqrt{n})$ query time. The results can be extended to other graphs that admit small balanced separators. The first oracle can be used to improve the time of counting the number of minimum $(s,t)$-cuts in planar and bounded genus graphs (the last paragraph of the main content). For the first oracle, the algorithm works in a divide-and-conquer manner. It first computes a separator $(A,B,C)$ with no edges between $A$ and $B$ and only $O(\\sqrt{n})$ vertices in $C$. Then all paths are divided into two classes: those intersecting $C$ and those don’t. The latter can be handled by recursion on $A$ and $B$. The former are divided according to the specific first intersecting vertex in $C$. The algorithm uses vertices in $C$ as intermediaries. For each $c\\in C$, it computes and stores the cardinality of two sets: the set of $s-c$ paths which intersects $C$ first at $c$ and the set of $c-t$ paths. Then the number of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ is the product of those two cardinality because there is a bijection between the set of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ and the Cartesian product of those two sets (which is the main technical aspect of their contribution). Therefore, the number of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ can be computed by summing over all $c\\in C$ in the query procedure. The algorithm for the second oracle works similarly. It computes shortest paths instead of all paths, stores the weights of those paths as well as the number of them. In the query procedure, it counts only those paths having the shortest weights. Note that the similar bijection doesn’t hold for all those sub-paths, but holds for those achieving the shortest weights, which is exactly what the query procedure requires to count. [Overall assessment] This paper initiate the study on counting oracles for various paths. The first result can be used to improve the time of counting minimum $s-t$-cuts in planar and bounded genus graphs. It’s interesting to known whether there are other applications since the algorithms are sort of restricted. Some more specific comments: At the beginning of section 1.1, the first two works are only for planar graphs. Algorithm 1 only applies to undirected graphs with positive edge weights. It applies to digraphs by a trivial modification. In lemma 3, the time should be $T(n)+O(m)$, since the algorithm is not restricted to planar graphs. Section 5 has the same problem. In section 5, the solutions to some recurrences are wrong. There are a few typos such as: “the separator” -&gt; “the separator C” in section 3 “CONSTRUCTORACLE” -&gt; “CONSTRUCTSHORTESTPATHORACLE” in Alg. 4. “positive edge weights” and “shortest” should be added in Theorem 14 2. Results apply to both undirected graphs and digraphs, can be extended to multigraphs. Algorithm 1 only applies to “positively weighted undirected graphs”. It applies to directed graphs by removing the “else if” segment. Lemma 3, the running time should be $T(n)+O(m)$, unless it’s restricted to plannar graphs. CountPath(G,u): G is a DAG CountShortestPath(G,u): G is positively weighted. 3. Lemma 7, note that the condition “G is a DAG”, to be checked again. The algorithm computes an oracle answering the number of paths between any two veritces in a plannar DAG. It takes $O(n^{1.5})$ time and $O(n^{1.5})$ space to construct and answers each query in time $O(\\sqrt{n})$. The algorithm works in a divide-and-conquer manner. It first computes a balanced separator $(A,B,C)$. Then all paths are divided to two classes: those intersecting C and those don’t. The latter can be counted by recurrsion. It remains to count the former. The former are divided according to the specific first intersecting vertex in C. For every pair $(s,t)$, the algorithm computes and stores for each $c\\in C$ the number of simple paths from $s$ to $c$, which intersects $C$ first at $c$, and the number of simple paths from $c$ to $t$. Then the number of paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ is the product of them. Therefore, the number of paths intersecting C can be computed by summing over all $c\\in C$. In lemma 7, it’s G is DAG that makes the concatenation of $s-c$ sub-path and $c-t$ sub-path work, i.e. the resulted $s-c-t$ path is a “simple” path. 4. The second algorithm computes an oracle answering the number of shortest paths between any two vertices in a plannar graph (directed or undirected) with positive edge weights. The algorithms costs the same resources as the first one. It also works as similar as it with small modification. In the construction procedure, it computes and stores the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $c$ and from $c$ to $t$ instead of all the paths. Meanwhile, it also records the weights of those paths. In the query procedure, the algorithm examine each possible path and only count those having the shortest weight. The concatenated $s-c-t$ path is not necessarily simple, but the really counted $s-c-t$ in the query procedure must be simple."},{"title":"","date":"2018-10-15T14:11:24.000Z","updated":"2018-10-15T14:11:24.000Z","comments":true,"path":"default/test.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/default/test.html","excerpt":"CCMark notes 1. set options.breaks = false 2. one single list item is legal 3. set xhtml = true 4. inline link doesn’t allow extra whitespaces, newlines 5. quotes in title of link should be escaped 6. merge order of strong, em (***) 7. boost::regex_match return false, but match.empty() != tru","text":"CCMark notes set options.breaks = false one single list item is legal set xhtml = true inline link doesn’t allow extra whitespaces, newlines quotes in title of link should be escaped merge order of strong, em (***) boost::regex_match return false, but match.empty() != true, strange !

数字科技（智能机器）的发展分化了劳动力市场（数字鸿沟），筛选出了三类获益人： 高级技术工人：擅长使用智能机器进行创造性工作 超级明星：行业翘楚，胜者通吃（因为远程协作，信息\b流通等技术） 所有者：即所谓的资本家，因为劳动力限制得到大为降低 ==学习复杂技能(不可复制），将技能推向极限来创造实在的价值、成果== 培养和深化自己的头脑 深度专注、刻意学习(deliberate practice) 注意力全情投入 （需要深度工作） 适时得到反馈，从而调整方法 专注于某一项特定技能，反复利用同一大脑回路，能有效的固化这项技能 (神经反射，熟能生巧) 高质量产生 ＝ 时间 x 专注度 注意力残留：多任务并行效率低于按次序完成多项任务 （参考js单线程，以前好像在\b知乎上看到有人讲这个） ==长时间、无干扰、高度专注于单一任务== 注意力管理 集中注意力 vs. 分散注意力 负面恐惧、遗憾 vs. 生活中的美好事物，忽略负面信息 （工作内容） 游手好闲是万恶之源。当你失去关注点时，头脑不会想着生活中的好事，而会纠缠于生活中可能出现的问题 一个人的身体或大脑在自觉努力完成某项艰难且有价值的工作过程中达到极限时，往往是最优体验发生的时候 工作其实比休闲时光更容易带来享受，头脑喜欢挑战 深度工作带来的心流经历可以为你带来深度的满足感 从哲学上看 对工作有某种神圣感（所谓的匠心？），认识到自己工作的意义，能很大程度上得到满足感，从而产生正反馈的激励作用。\b 深度工作准则 准则1：工作要深入 （培养工作的习惯） 欲望是常态，而非个例 工作生活中诱惑是很多的，不要高估自己的抵抗力。意志力是有限的，每次抵抗都会有消耗。 越过良好的意图，在工作生活中加入一些特别设计的惯例和固定程序。以下有6种策略： 首先要选定你的深度哲学：\b 禁欲 （苦修式） 双峰 (例如每年一个月”隐居“，其它时间正常) 节奏：按计划每天特定时候深度工作 新闻记者：由于工作的特殊性，需要随时随地进入深度\b工作 习惯化：将深度工作习惯化（具体的习惯要看个人是否合适） 要有大手笔：适当加大精力、金钱的投入来创造深度工作的良好环境（包括\b物理和心理） 不要独自工作：恰当的加入协作 像经\b商一样执行 关注点放到极端重要的事情上 （你想做的事情越多，完成的事情越少） 抓信引领性指标 （及时反馈，如深度工作的时间） 准备一个醒目的记分板 （记录，提醒，公开化来得到动力） 定期问责 （反馈，调整） 图安逸： 劳逸结合 准则2：拥抱无聊 一旦你适应了分心，你就会迷恋于此 策略：预先\b计划好网络使用时间，在其它时间避免使用网络 ==使用令人分必的网络本身，并不能减少你大脑专注的能力。实际上减损这种能力的行为是，稍有无聊或有一点点认知上的挑战，就从低刺激、高价值的活动转向高刺激、低价值的活动，这使得你的大脑不能容忍没有新\b奇性的东西== （好像也是在知乎上看到过？） 通过分割网络（相当于分割了分心），减少了自己分心的次数，这样就增强了自己控制注意力的力量。 注意： 即使工作需要大量使用网络，该策略也适用 需要保证彻底地屏藩网络 在工作外也按\b计划使用\b网络，可以进一步提升专注训练的效果 准则3：远离社交媒体 明确在你的职业和个人生活中决定成功与幸福的核心因素，只有一种工\b具对这些因素的实际益处大于实际害处时才选择使用它。 如果你想抵御娱乐网站对你时间和精力的诱惑，那么就给大脑找一些高质量的替代活动 准则4：摒弃浮浅 减少浮浅工作的时间，保持深度工作。 工作时间减少了，但是效率增加了。 一天的每一分钟都要做好计划（太严格了吧？），定量分析每一项活动的深度 （合理的规划） update: 2017-08-24"},{"title":"Design Patterns","date":"2018-07-27T16:23:22.000Z","updated":"2018-07-27T15:56:49.000Z","comments":true,"path":"dev/design

Online version of “Exploring ES6” by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer If you really want to understand ES6, you have to understand how each feature works, even when you’re dealing with unusual situations and edge cases. What sets Axel Rauschmayer’s Exploring ES6 apart from other books is that it really cares about the inner workings of ECMAScript. It doesn’t just describe the common use cases that you probably already understand. It digs deep into the semantics and, where necessary, wallows in the edge cases. It explains why features work the way that they work and how they are used in realistic code. Assimilate the material in this book and you will be an ES6 expert. 2.

Usually it is placed in &lt;head&gt;. Placing it at the bottom of page can avoid possible loading delay. 3. Data types JavaScript has six data types. Five data types are primitives: string number boolean null undefined symbol: (since ES2015) A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. One type is complex: object ( includes array, function ) You can consider it a bug in JavaScript that typeof null is an object. It should be null. 1234typeof undefined // undefinedtypeof null // objectnull === undefined // falsenull == undefined // true 4. Declaration There are three types of declarations (since ES6): var: global variable or function level variable. let: block level local variable. const: read-only constant. Itself can’t be assigned while it’s properties can. Must be initialized. It’s scope is the same as ‘let’ value variables declared by ‘let’ and ‘var’ with no initial value has the value “undefined” variable scope global: declared outside of function local: declared in function function level 1234if (true) &#123; var x = 5;&#125;console.log(x); // x is 5 block level 1234if (true) &#123; let y = 5;&#125;console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined variable hositing and function hoisting Variables in JavaScript are in a sense “hoisted” or lifted to the top of the function or statement. However, variables that are hoisted will return a value of undefined. In ECMAScript 2015, let (const) will not hoist the variable to the top of the block. For functions, only function declaration gets hoisted to the top and not the function expression. 12345678910111213141516/* Function declaration */foo(); // \"bar\"function foo() &#123; console.log(\"bar\");&#125;/* Function expression */baz(); // TypeError: baz is not a functionvar baz = function() &#123; console.log(\"bar2\");&#125;; global variables Global variables are in fact properties of the global object.

Introduction Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents. The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. John Gruber’s canonical description of Markdown’s syntax does not specify the syntax unambiguously. A group of fans of Markdown propose a standard unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown: the CommonMark sepc. 2. Prlimilaries of CommonMark Below are some important points, for detail refer to http://spec.commonmark.org/ Blocks and inlines We can think of a document as a sequence of blocks—structural elements like paragraphs, block quotations, lists, headings, rules, and code blocks. Some blocks (like block quotes and list items) contain other blocks; others (like headings and paragraphs) contain inline content—text, links, emphasized text, images, code, and so on. Indicators of block structure always take precedence over indicators of inline structure. So, for example, the following is a list with two items, not a list with one item containing a code span: 12- `one- two` produces `one two` Blocks can be divided into two types: container blocks and leaf blocks. Leaf blocks includes: Thematic breaks ATX headings and setext headings Indented code blocks and Fenced code blocks Html blocks Link reference definitions Paragraphs Blank lines Container blocks includes: Block quotes List items Lists Inlines are parsed sequentially from the beginning of the character stream to the end (left to right, in left-to-right languages). It includes: Backslash escapes Entity and numeric character references Code spans: Code span backticks have higher precedence than any other inline constructs except HTML tags and autolinks. Emphasis and strong emphasis Links (inline links vs. reference links) Images Autolinks Raw HTML Hard line breaks (line break preceded by two or more spaces) Soft line breaks (regular line break) Textual content Parsing strategy Parsing has two phases: In the first phase, lines of input are consumed and the block structure of the document—its division into paragraphs, block quotes, list items, and so on—is constructed. Text is assigned to these blocks but not parsed. Link reference definitions are parsed and a map of links is constructed. In the second phase, the raw text contents of paragraphs and headings are parsed into sequences of Markdown inline elements (strings, code spans, links, emphasis, and so on), using the map of link references constructed in phase 1. At each point in processing, the document is represented as a tree of blocks. The root of the tree is a document block. The document may have any number of other blocks as children. These children may, in turn, have other blocks as children. In phase 1, the last child of a block is normally considered open, meaning that subsequent lines of input can alter its contents. (Blocks that are not open are closed.) Once all of the input has been parsed, all open blocks are closed. Then in phase 2, We “walk the tree,” visiting every node, and parse raw string contents of paragraphs and headings as inlines. Github flavored Markdown GFM info page GFM cheatsheet Below are some features not included in CommonMark spec. Strikethrough uses two tildes. Scratch this. Syntax highlighting (only support fenced code blocks) Tables Task list Finish my changes Push my commits to GitHub Open a pull request If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you’ll need to escape it with : (Optional) Open a followup issue Remarkable Refer to remarkable on github for details.

Markdown-preview-enhanced Refer to Markdown Preview Enhanced for details. This atom plugin uses remarkable to render markdown. Here is how it works: remarkable to convert markdown to html. KaTeX or MathJax to render math expressions. (KaTeX Supported functions/symbols) expression within $...$ will be rendered normally. expression within $$...$$ will be rendered in displayMode. if you want to enable math highlighting, try language-gfm-enhanced package. You can choose your math rendering method from settings panel. MathJax supports more symbols, but it has slower rendering speed compared to KaTeX. mermaid to render flowchart and sequence diagram. code block within {mermaid} notation will be rendered by mermaid check mermaid doc for more information about how to create flowchart and sequence diagram PlantUML to create multiple kinds of graph. (Java is required) You can install Graphviz (not required) to generate all diagram types. code block within {puml} or {plantuml} notation will be rendered by PlantUML. WaveDrom to create digital timing diagram. code block within {wavedrom} notation will be rendered by wavedrom. Viz.js to render dot language graph. code block within {viz} notation will be rendered by Viz.js. add engine:[engine_name] in the first line of code block with {viz} to choose different render engine reveal.js to render beautiful presentations.

\\\\frac{d S}{d\\\\theta d\\\\rho} d\\\\theta d\\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\partial S}{\\\\partial\\\\theta \\\\partial\\\\rho} d\\\\theta d\\\\rho = \\\\rho d\\\\rho d\\\\theta$\\n* 一种错解是 $dS=d(1/2\\\\rho^2\\\\theta) =\\\\rho\\\\theta d\\\\rho + 1/2\\\\rho^2 d\\\\theta$, 该表达式本身没问题，但无法利用对其积分来解原问题。\\n* 用直观图形表示，在$(\\\\rho,\\\\theta)$点时，分别增加$d\\\\rho,d\\\\theta$, 则面积增加有三个部分，用扇形公式可计算出分别是$1/2\\\\rho^2 d\\\\theta, \\\\theta\\\\rho d\\\\rho, \\\\rho d\\\\rho d\\\\theta$, 用于二元积分时，只需取最后一项$\\\\rho d\\\\rho d\\\\theta$. 这是因为积分在极限意义下为求和，二元求和$\\\\Sigma_x\\\\Sigma_y \\\\Delta x\\\\Delta y$ 不仅是对直角线上的$\\\\Delta x\\\\Delta y$ 求和，而是对整个矩阵求和。所以二元积分看似只取了对角线一项，实际上求的是整个微分$dS$. 简单点的情况，可以考虑直角坐标上矩形的积分，使用的是$dxdy$, 而非 $dS=xdy+ydx$\\n##

Linkage](#2-linkage)\\n\\n\\nGenerally, there are several output (not intermediate) targets to be built. The order in which they are built is specified manually. E.g. specified in target dependencies in Xcode, in makefile for linux, etc.\\n\\nFor each target, sources files (.c, .cpp) are translated to translation units in the order specified as above. (May be the order doesn't make difference because there exists no dependencies)\\n\\nFor details on xcode, refer to [The Build Process](https://www.objc.io/issues/6-build-tools/build-process/#build-settings)\\nFor makefile, refer to:\\n[A Simple Makefile Tutorial](http://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/)\\n[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html)\\n\\n## Phases Of Translation\\n* A translation unit is the combination of a source files, included headers and source files less any source lines skipped by conditional inclusion preprocessor directive.\\n* The standard defines 9 phases in the translation. The first four correspond to preprocessing, the next three are the compilation (including assembly), the next one is the instantiation of templates (producing instantiation units) and the last one is the linking.\\n* In practice the eighth phase (the instantiation of templates) is often done during the compilation process but some compilers delay it to the linking phase and some spread it in the two.\\n\\nFor detail, refer to: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/translation_phases\\n\\nFor clang, refer to [Mach-O Executables](https://www.objc.io/issues/6-build-tools/mach-o-executables/) (including details on sections in memory)\\n\\n## Other notes\\n\\n### 1. Preprocessor\\nThe preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler.\\n#### Directives\\nThe preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format:\\n* \\\\# character\\n* preprocessing instruction (one of define, undef, include, if, ifdef, ifndef, else, elif, endif, line, error, pragma) [^1]\\n* arguments (depends on the instruction)\\n* line break\\n\\nThe null directive (# followed by a line break) is allowed and has no effect.\\n\\n[^1]: These are the directives defined by the standard. The standard does not define behavior for other directives: they might be ignored, have some useful meaning, or cause a compile-time error. Even if otherwise ignored, they are removed from the source code when the preprocessor is done. A common non-standard extension is the directive #warning which emits a user-defined message during compilation.\\n\\n#### Capabilities\\nThe preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities:\\nconditionally compile of parts of source file (controlled by directive #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #elif and #endif).\\nreplace text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives #define and #undef, and operators # and ##)\\ninclude other files (controlled by directive #include and checked with __has_include (since C\\\\++17 ))\\ncause an error (controlled by directive #error)\\nThe following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled:\\nimplementation defined behavior (controlled by directive #pragma and operator _Pragma (since C\\\\++11))\\nfile name and line information available to the preprocessor (controlled by directives #line)\\n\\n### 2. Linkage\\nLinkage of entity (variable, function, class, type ,template, namespace, etc.) decides whether it can be seen in other places (other translation units, other scopes of the same translation unit).\\nThere are there kinds of linkage: no linkage, internal linkage, external linkage.\\n[Internal and External Linkage in C++ ( by Peter Goldsborough )](http://www.goldsborough.me/c/c++/linker/2016/03/30/19-34-25-internal_and_external_linkage_in_c++/)\\n\",[[1540267590542,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[-1,51,\"\"]],[51,76],[51,51]]],[1540267590960,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[-1,52,\"\\n\"]],[51,51],[50,50]]]],null,\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\"]]}"},{"title":"","date":"2018-10-27T10:44:02.000Z","updated":"2018-10-27T08:07:18.000Z","comments":true,"path":"research/collections.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/research/collections.html","excerpt":"collections Lectures steiner tree – lecture by MIT steiner tree: sets R and S reduction to metric steiner tree minimum spanning tree: cost within $2\\cdot OPT$ steiner forest: 2-approximation algorithm","text":"collections Lectures steiner tree – lecture by MIT steiner tree: sets R and S reduction to metric steiner tree minimum spanning tree: cost within $2\\cdot OPT$ steiner forest: 2-approximation algorithm"},{"title":"","date":"2018-10-27T10:44:02.000Z","updated":"2018-10-27T08:07:19.000Z","comments":true,"path":"research/collections.resource/commit.json","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/research/collections.resource/commit.json","excerpt":"{\"compress\":true,\"commitItems\":[[\"46dad0f5-722c-4bfa-8ece-ba000cd2d7fc\",1540627639846,\"\",[[1540627589875,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[1,0,\"# collections\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]],[0,0],[16,16]]],[1540627591853,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[1,16,\"## Lectures\\n[steiner tree -- lecture by MIT](http://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18434S06/stei","text":"{\"compress\":true,\"commitItems\":[[\"46dad0f5-722c-4bfa-8ece-ba000cd2d7fc\",1540627639846,\"\",[[1540627589875,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[1,0,\"# collections\\n\\n\\n\\n\"]],[0,0],[16,16]]],[1540627591853,[\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\",[[1,16,\"## Lectures\\n[steiner tree -- lecture by MIT](http://math.mit.edu/~goemans/18434S06/steiner-adriana.pdf)\\nsteiner tree: sets R and S\\nreduction to metric steiner tree\\nminimum spanning tree: cost within $2\\\\cdot OPT$\\nsteiner forest: 2-approximation algorithm\"]],[16,16],[269,269]]]],null,\"IIIS@dujcel-PC\"]]}"},{"title":"","date":"2018-10-27T10:44:02.000Z","updated":"2018-10-27T08:32:02.000Z","comments":true,"path":"research/data structure.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/research/data structure.html","excerpt":"data structure Miscs LCA, RMQ, LA(level ancestor) all have $$ distance oracles.

This article illustrate how promise works by writing its own promise library squab. It clearly shows what “promise” generally looks like. Promise by 廖雪锋 Summary 注意区分：决议（resolve), 完成（fulfill) 拒绝（reject) 异常(error) A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never. Before ES6, it’s just a syntactical sugar for asynchronous function callback. (Not for ES6, in which promise has ==built-in async support==.) ES6在事件队列（macroqueue)的基础上，增加了一个任务队列（microqueue)。 microqueue的优先级更高，js引擎每处理完一个macroqueue事件，它都会优先处理所有的microqueue中的事件，等microqueue中的事件处理完后再处理macroqueue中的下一个事件。 1234567891011121314151617function promisify(v)&#123; return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) &#123; console.log(v) resolve(v+2) console.log(v+1) &#125;)&#125;let p = promisify(0)console.log('-2')setTimeout(()=&gt;&#123; console.log('-1')&#125;,0)p.then((v)=&gt;&#123; promisify(v)&#125;)// 0 1 -2 2 3 -1 Problems with callback 非线性，难理解，易出错 信任问题，控制反转 过早调用 （Zalgo风险） 过晚调用（或不调用) 调用次数过多或过少 未能传递所需的环境或参数 吞掉可能出现的错误和异常 Promise并没有摈弃回调，只是把回调的安排转交给了一个位于我们和其它工具之间的可信任的中介机制。 Some notes for promise: 流程控制 注册事件 如何调度的:同一promise的then调用顺序？不同promise的then调用顺序？ 由于promise决议后只能有一个值（或一个拒绝理由), resolve/reject 只接受一个参数，其它参数会被忽略(==避免传递参数混乱==)。多次调用resolve 也会只执行第一个（==避免过多调用==）。 12345678910111213function promisify(v)&#123; return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) &#123; console.log(v) resolve(v+1,v+2) resolve(v+3,v+4) &#125;)&#125;let p = promisify(0)p.then((v,w)=&gt;&#123; console.log(v,w)&#125;)//0 1 Promise 把整个操作（包括异常）变成了异步，避免了Zalgo风险. 从而使得then可以在‘操作’的后面提供 resolve/reject 参数. 注意，构造promise时，虽然 resolve/reject 是以参数形式存在，但是可以自由使用它们。以下面的promisify为例： 12345function request(url)&#123; return new Promise( function(resolve,reject)&#123; ajax(url,resolve); &#125;);&#125; ajax函数是立即执行的，它可以把 （此时空的）resolve 当作回调。然而，当ajax函数异步完成后需要调用 resolve 时，Promise机制可以保证 resolve的调用顺利地进行。如何保证？首先ajax是异步调用resolve的，即使把ajax换成同步函数，promise也会使其异步化（==避免过早调用==），这样可以保证在request同一个tick中，通过then得到的resolve都是已经准备就绪的。注意，即使不在同一个tick中注册的resolve函数也会被顺利执行(==避免过晚或过少调用==）。 1234567891011121314151617181920212223function promisify(val)&#123; return new Promise(function(resolve,reject)&#123; console.log(val); resolve(); &#125;)&#125;console.log(1)let p = promisify(2)console.log(3)let q = promisify(4)let z = q.then(()=&gt;&#123; console.log(7) return p.then(()=&gt;&#123; console.log(9) &#125;)&#125;)console.log(5)p.then(()=&gt;&#123; console.log(8)&#125;)console.log(6)//1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Promise.resolve() 会展开thenable的值,从而得到可信任的promise。若传入的参数是真正的promise, Promise.resolve() 什么都不会做，只会直接返回这个参数。 resolve和reject的返回值会作为then返回的新promise的决议值。resolve/reject都可以得到新的未决议的promise (可能fullfill,也可能reject). 注意区分当前promise和then得到的新promise, 当前reject，但then得到的新promise是既可以fullfill又可以reject的。 然而，new Promise中的 resolve/reject则不同。 若提供的参数是promise, resolve会展开它，决议值是该参数promise的决议值（可能是完成的也可能是拒绝的）。而reject的决议值则只能是拒绝的。因此 new Promise( function(resolve,reject){}) 中的 resolve 确实是“决议” （而非完成）的意思。而then方法中最好理解为 then(fulfilled, rejected). 前者中resolve/reject 是形参，后者中 fulfilled/rejected 是实参。 then未提供resolve或reject时，默认的resolve/reject会把当前决议值（或拒绝理由）传递下去。catch(err){} 则是then(null, function(err){}) 的缩写。 promise chain中的错误（异常或reject)可以通过在chain的末端加一个catch()来处理，如果中间的then没有rejected处理，那么默认的rejected函数会将该错误往下传。唯一的问题是最后的catch仍返回一个可能出错的promise，这个问题ES6本身没有提供解决方案。 new Promise() new Promise(function(resolve,reject){}) 中形参resolve/reject对应的实参是 Promise.resolve/Promise.reject. 以下两种构造是等价的 12let p =new Promise(function(resolve,reject)&#123;resolve(1);&#125;);let q = Promise.resolve(1); new Promise() 中的代码是立即执行的（当前tick)， 其中的resolve/reject语句是异步执行的，其它语句（之前和之后的）可以看作是同步的。 1234567891011121314function promisify(v)&#123; return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) &#123; console.log(v) resolve(v+2) console.log(v+1) &#125;)&#125;let p = promisify(0)p.then((v)=&gt;&#123; console.log(v)&#125;)// 0 1 2 new Promise(null) 并不会返回一个rejected promise, 而是抛出异常。因为promise构造过程中出现异常会使得promise构造失败。 then方法 调用promise的then() 会自动创建一个新的promise从调用返回 在then的resolve/reject内部，如果返回一个值或抛出一个异常，新返回的promise就相应地决议为该值. 如果resolve/reject 返回一个promise, 它将会被==展开==，不管它的决议值是什么，都会成为then返回的新promise的决议值。(新返回的promise的决议值是那个promise展开后的值，不是那个promise本身） 其它API all, race, none, any, first, last Promise局限性 promise chain返回的是最后一个promise, 没有保存中间promise的引用，无法在外面给中间的promise关联处理函数。若中间的promise有自己的错误处理，则最后的promise不会得到错误的通知 （除非中间的错误处理函数继续产生拒绝）。这与try...catch...类似。 promise只能决议为单一值，需要多个值的话可以封闭成单个值，但是在复杂的场景中会比较笨重。一种方法是可以分解成多个promise后用promise.all来处理。 promise只能决议一次，不能像监听事件一样，事件每发生一次相应的监听函数就会被调用一次。一种方法是每次事件触发后构造一个新的promise. 已有代码大都基于回调，需要手动promisify. 可以编写类似于Promise.wrap()的函数来解决，该wrap函数返回一个promisory. promisory调用才返回一个promise. 例如 let request = Promise.wrap(ajax); ES6并未提供类似的wrap函数。 promise无法取消。一种方法是用“门” 来hack. 单独的promise不应该可取消，但是取消一个promise chain是合理的。 Promise/A+ The official specification A ‘promise’ is an object or function with a then method whose behavior conforms to this specification. A promise must be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When pending, a promise: may transition to either the fulfilled or rejected state. When fulfilled, a promise: must not transition to any other state. must have a value, which must not change. When rejected, a promise: must not transition to any other state. must have a reason, which must not change. Here, “must not change” means immutable identity (i.e. ===), but does not imply deep immutability. A promise must provide a then method to access its current or eventual value or reason. A promise’s then method accepts two arguments (both are optional, non-function are ignored): 1promise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected) then must return a promise 1234567891011121314'use strict';var p1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) &#123; console.log('p1 creating...'); //execute immediately reject('rejecting'); //transit to fulfilled resolve('resolving'); //invalid console.log('p1 created'); //execute immediately&#125;);console.log(typeof p1); //objectconsole.log(p1);p1.then(function (result) &#123; console.log(result)&#125;, function (err) &#123; console.log(err)&#125;); output: 12345p1 creating...p1 createdobjectPromise &#123; &lt;rejected&gt; &apos;rejecting&apos; &#125;rejecting"},{"title":"杂记","date":"2018-07-27T16:23:23.000Z","updated":"2018-07-27T15:58:31.000Z","comments":true,"path":"Languages/python/python杂记.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/Languages/python/python杂记.html","excerpt":"types分类 immutable: number, string, tuple mutable: list, dict, class-object Function arguments are passed by values: immutable objects are copied by value, while mutable objects are copied by aliasing. classes themselves are objects.

Python always follows a reference to an object whenever the reference is used. Types and Operations Objects are pieces of memory, with values and sets of associated operations. Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of obj The Python Conceptual Hierarchy: Programs are composed of modules. Modules contain statements. Statements contain expressions. Expressions create and process objects. In formal terms, this means that Python is dynamically typed , a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also strongly typed, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type. Core Types Immutable: number, string, tuple, bytes Mutable: list, dictionary, set, bytearray Primitive: number Collection: Sequence: string, tuple, bytes, list, bytearray Mapping: dictionary, set bytearray is a distinct hybrid of immutable bytes strings (whose b’…’ syntax is required in 3.X and optional in 2.X) and mutable lists (coded and displayed in [] ). Generic operations that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g. len(X) , X[0] ), but type-specific operations are method calls (e.g., aString.upper() ). Both dir and help also accept as arguments either a real object (like our string S) , or the name of a data type (like str , list , and dict ). As a notable difference, Python 2.X allows its normal and Unicode strings to be mixed in expressions as long as the normal string is all ASCII; in contrast, Python 3.X has a tighter model that never allows its normal and byte strings to mix without explicit conversion. None of the string object’s own methods support pattern-based text processing. Unlike out-of-bounds assignments in lists, which are forbidden, assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys, fetching a nonexistent key is still a mistake. (Use the get() method) A file’s contents are always a string in your script, regardless of the type of data the file contains: 1&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in open('data.txt'): print(line) Text files represent content as normal str strings and perform unicode encoding and decoding automatically when writing and reading data, while binary files represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered. Sets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects. Decimal, Fraction, booleans As you’ll learn, in Python, we code to object interfaces (operations supported), not to types. Numbers Floating-point numbers are implemented as C “doubles” in standard CPython, and therefore get as much precision as the C compiler used to build the Python interpreter gives to doubles. built-in calls: hex(I), oct(I), bin(I), int(str,base), X.bit_length(), round(X), X.as_integer_ratio() Internally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers Comparison operators may be chained: X &lt; Y &lt; Z produces the same result as X &lt; Y and Y &lt; Z . 12&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 == 2 &lt; 3 # Same as: 1 == 2 and 2 &lt; 3False # Not same as: False &lt; 3 (which means 0 &lt; 3, which is true!) In recent Pythons, the slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)]. In Python 3.X, nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons are not allowed and raise exceptions; this includes sorts by proxy. Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so bind more tightly in mixed expressions. Operators in the same row in Table 5-2 generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right). Besides mixing operators in expressions, you can also mix numeric types: in mixed-type numeric expressions, Python first converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand, and then performs the math on same-type operands. Python ranks the complexity of numeric types like so: integers are simpler than floating point numbers, which are simpler than complex numbers. In general, Python does not convert across any other type boundaries automatically. Adding a string to an integer, for example, results in an error, unless you manually convert one or the other. In 3.X, the / now always performs true division, returning a float result that includes any remainder, regardless of operand types. The // performs floor division, which truncates the remainder and returns an integer for integer operands or a float if any operand is a float. The // operator truncates the result down to its floor, which means the closest whole number below the true result. Frozenset Internally, the names True and False are instances of bool , which is in turn just a subclass (in the object oriented sense) of the built-in integer type int . True and False behave exactly like the integers 1 and 0, except that they have customized printing logic. 12&gt;&gt;&gt; True + 4 # (Hmmm)5 Numpy, Scipy The dynamic typing A variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time. Variables always link to objects and never to other variables, but larger objects may link to other objects (for instance, a list object has links to the objects it contains). These links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory Technically speaking, objects have more structure than just enough space to represent their values. Each object also has two standard header fields: a type designator used to mark the type of the object, and a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object. reference counter, cyclic reference sys.getrefcount(X) If a[:], a[k] appears in expression, they are copied. e.g. after b=a[:3], b refers to a new object. If a[:], a[k] appears in left side of assignment, they referred to the original object. e.g. after a=[0,1,2] a[:] = [0,1], a becomes [0,1] Because everything seems to work by assignment and references in Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. As you’ll see, it works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python; weakref String String literal forms: Single quotes: ‘spa&quot;m’ Double quotes: “spa’m” Triple quotes: ‘’’… spam …’’’ , “”&quot;… spam …&quot;&quot;&quot; Escape sequences: “s\\tp\\na\\0m” Raw strings: r&quot;C:\\new\\test.spm&quot; Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): b’sp\\x01am’ Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): u’eggs\\u0020spam’ In fact, 3.X defines str strings formally as sequences of Unicode code points, not bytes, to make this clear. There’s more on how strings are stored internally in Chapter 37 if you care to know. Some escape sequences allow you to embed absolute binary values into the characters of a string. Python keeps both the string’s length and text in memory. In fact, no character terminates a string in Python Notice that Python displays nonprintable characters in hex, regardless of how they were specified. That is, r&quot;…&quot; is not a valid string literal—a raw string cannot end in an odd number of backslashes. If you need to end a raw string with a single backslash, you can use two and slice off the second (r’1\\nb\\tc\\’[:-1]), tack one on manually (r’1\\nb\\tc’ + ‘\\’), or skip the raw string syntax and just double up the backslashes in a normal string (‘1\\nb\\tc\\’). 1234567891011&gt;&gt;&gt; menu = &quot;&quot;&quot;spam # comments here added to string!... eggs # ditto... &quot;&quot;&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt; menu&apos;spam # comments here added to string!\\neggs # ditto\\n&apos;&gt;&gt;&gt; menu = (... &quot;spam\\n&quot; # comments here ignored... &quot;eggs\\n&quot; # but newlines not automatic... )&gt;&gt;&gt; menu&apos;spam\\neggs\\n&apos; built-in tool: ord() chr() The method call expression: object.method(arguments) is evaluated from left to right—Python will first fetch the method of the object and then call it, passing in both object and the arguments string formatting expressions and string formatting method calls Technically, the format built-in runs the subject object’s __format__ method, which the str.format method does internally for each formatted item. The % expressions tend to be a bit simpler and more concise; the format method has a handful of advanced features that the % expression does not, but even more involved formatting still seems to be essentially a draw in terms of complexity. 1&gt;&gt;&gt; from formats import commas, money Types Share Operation Sets by Categories: numbers sequences mappings Lists and Dictionaries Slice assignment, the last operation in the preceding example, replaces an entire section of a list in a single step. Because it can be a bit complex, it is perhaps best thought of as a combination of two steps: Deletion. The slice you specify to the left of the = is deleted. Insertion. The new items contained in the iterable object to the right of the = are inserted into the list on the left, at the place where the old slice was deleted. Note, L[2:5]=L[3:6], for instance, works fine because the value to be inserted is fetched before the deletion happens on the left. 12345678910&gt;&gt;&gt; L = [1]&gt;&gt;&gt; L[:0] = [2, 3, 4] # Insert all at :0, an empty slice at front&gt;&gt;&gt; L[2, 3, 4, 1]&gt;&gt;&gt; L[len(L):] = [5, 6, 7] # Insert all at len(L):, an empty slice at end&gt;&gt;&gt; L[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]&gt;&gt;&gt; L.extend([8, 9, 10]) # Insert all at end, named method&gt;&gt;&gt; L[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] The effect of L.append(X) is similar to L+[X], but while the former changes L in place, the latter makes a new list. In Python 3.X, this has changed: magnitude comparison of mixed types raises an exception instead of falling back on the fixed cross-type ordering. L.sort() vs. sorted built-in tools: reversed Like lists, dictionaries store object references (not copies, unless you ask for them explicitly) keys in 3.X returns an iterable object, instead of a physical list Unlike lists, however, whenever you assign a new dictionary key (one that hasn’t been assigned before) you create a new entry in the dictionary. In 3.X the dictionary keys , values , and items methods all return view objects , whereas in 2.X they return actual result lists. Besides being iterable, dictionary views also retain the original order of dictionary components, reflect future changes to the dictionary, and may support set operations. Unlike 2.X’s list results, though, dictionary views in 3.X are not carved in stone when created—they dynamically reflect future changes made to the dictionary after the view object has been created: In set operations, views may be mixed with other views, sets, and dictionaries; dictionaries are treated the same as their keys views in this context: 123456&gt;&gt;&gt; D = &#123;&apos;a&apos;: 1, &apos;b&apos;: 2, &apos;c&apos;: 3&#125;&gt;&gt;&gt; D.keys() &amp; D.keys() # Intersect keys views&#123;&apos;b&apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;a&apos;&#125;&gt;&gt;&gt; D.keys() &amp; &#123;&apos;b&apos;&#125; # Intersect keys and set&#123;&apos;b&apos;&#125;&gt;&gt;&gt; D. 12&gt;&gt;&gt; Ks.sort()AttributeError: &apos;dict_keys&apos; object has no attribute &apos;sort&apos; To work around this, in 3.X you must either convert to a list manually or use the sorted call (introduced in Chapter 4 and covered in this chapter) on either a keys view or the dictionary itself: OrderedDict Tuples, files and everything else As you can see, named tuples are a tuple/class/dictionary hybrid (In short, named tuples build new classes that extend the tuple type, inserting a property accessor method for each named field that maps the name to its position) Empty lines in the file come back as strings containing just a newline character, not as empty strings. 12&gt;&gt;&gt; myfile.readline() # Empty string: end-of-file&apos;&apos; Text files represent content as normal str strings, perform Unicode encoding and decoding automatically, and perform end-of-line translation by default. Binary files represent content as a special bytes string type and allow programs to access file content unaltered. pickle, shelve, json, struct In fact, when nested objects are present, Python automatically traverses data structures to apply comparisons from left to right, and as deeply as needed. More specifically, Python compares types as follows: Numbers are compared by relative magnitude, after conversion to the common highest type if needed. Strings are compared lexicographically (by the character set code point values returned by ord ), and character by character until the end or first mismatch (“abc”&lt; “ac” ). Lists and tuples are compared by comparing each component from left to right, and recursively for nested structures, until the end or first mismatch ([2] &gt; [1, 2] ). Sets are equal if both contain the same items (formally, if each is a subset of the other), and set relative magnitude comparisons apply subset and superset tests. Dictionaries compare as equal if their sorted (key, value) lists are equal. Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X, but they work in 2.X as though comparing sorted (key, value) lists. Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 &lt; ‘spam’ ) are errors in Python 3.X. They are allowed in Python 2.X, but use a fixed but arbitrary ordering rule based on type name string. By proxy, this also applies to sorts, which use comparisons internally: nonnumeric mixed-type collections cannot be sorted in 3.X. Python 3.X disallows mixed-type magnitude testing, except numeric types. More generally, the notions of true and false are intrinsic properties of every object in Python—each object is either true or false, as follows: Numbers are false if zero, and true otherwise. Other objects are false if empty, and true otherwise. That is, None is something, not nothing (despite its name!)—it is a real object and a real piece of memory that is created and given a built-in name by Python itself. In fact, even types themselves are an object type in Python. Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage. For classic classes in Python 2.X, all class instances are instead of the type “instance,” and we must compare instance __class__ attributes to compare their types meaningfully. Repetition Adds One Level Deep 123&gt;&gt;&gt; L = [4, 5, 6]&gt;&gt;&gt; X = L * 4 # Like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...&gt;&gt;&gt; Y = [L] * 4 # [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...] If you remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much more sense Beware of Cyclic Data Structure 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; L = ['grail'] # Append reference to same object&gt;&gt;&gt; L.append(L) # Generates cycle in object: [...]&gt;&gt;&gt; L['grail', [...]] Statements and Syntax Assignments, Expressions, and Prints Assignments create object references. (i.e. link a name with an object) They always create references to objects instead of copying the objects. Names are created when first assigned. Names must be assigned before referenced. Module imports, function and class definitions, for loop variables, and function arguments are all implicit assignments. sequence assignment—any sequence of names can be assigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items one at a time by position. In fact, the original tuple and list assignment forms in Python have been generalized to accept any type of sequence (really, iterable) on the right as long as it is of the same length as the sequence on the left. Multiple-target assignment: Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object farthest to the right) to all the targets on the left. In tuple/list assignment, Python creates a temporary tuple that saves the original values of the variables on the right before assigning. we can even assign nested sequences, and Python unpacks their parts according to their shape, as expected. The sequence-nesting shape of the object on the left must match that of the object on the right. This nested tuple (really, sequence) unpacking assignment form works for function argument lists in Python 2.X (though not in 3.X) In short, a single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target in order to specify a more general matching against the sequence—the starred name is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names. In fact, the starred name can appear anywhere in the target. This is similar in spirit to slicing, but not exactly the same—a sequence unpacking assignment always returns a list for multiple matched items, whereas slicing returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; a, *b = &apos;spam&apos;&gt;&gt;&gt; a, b(&apos;s&apos;, [&apos;p&apos;, &apos;a&apos;, &apos;m&apos;])&gt;&gt;&gt; S[0], S[1:] # Slices are type-specific, * assignment always returns a list(&apos;s&apos;, &apos;pam&apos;) Finally, errors can still be triggered if there is more than one starred name, if there are too few values and no star (as before), and if the starred name is not itself coded inside a sequence: 12&gt;&gt;&gt; *a = seqSyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple For augmented assignments, inplace operations may be applied for mutable objects as an optimization. 12345678910&gt;&gt;&gt; L = [1, 2]&gt;&gt;&gt; L = L + [3] # Concatenate: slower&gt;&gt;&gt; L[1, 2, 3]&gt;&gt;&gt; L.append(4) # Faster, but in place&gt;&gt;&gt; L[1, 2, 3, 4]&gt;&gt;&gt; L += [9, 10] # Mapped to L.extend([9, 10])&gt;&gt;&gt; L[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] Note however, that because of this equivalence += for a list is not exactly the same as a + and = in all cases—for lists += allows arbitrary sequences (just like extend), but concatenation normally does not: 123456&gt;&gt;&gt; L = []&gt;&gt;&gt; L += &apos;spam&apos; # += and extend allow any sequence, but + does not!&gt;&gt;&gt; L[&apos;s&apos;, &apos;p&apos;, &apos;a&apos;, &apos;m&apos;]&gt;&gt;&gt; L = L + &apos;spam&apos;TypeError: can only concatenate list (not &quot;str&quot;) to list Although Python now supports statements like X += Y, it still does not have C’s auto-increment/decrement operators (e.g., X++, −−X). Naming For portability, case also matters in the names of imported module files, even on platforms where the filesystems are case-insensitive. True, False, and None, are somewhat unusual in meaning—they also appear in the built-in scope of Python described in Chapter 17, and they are technically names assigned to objects. Names that begin with a single underscore (_X) are not imported by a from module import * statement Names that begin with two underscores and do not end with two more (__X) are localized (“mangled”) to enclosing classes. Expression Statements In Python, you can use an expression as a statement, too. Expressions are commonly used as statements in two situations: For calls to functions and methods For printing values at the interactive prompt A statement that is not an expression must generally appear on a line all by itself, not nested in a larger syntactic structure. For example, Python doesn’t allow you to embed assignment statements (=) in other expressions. Besides, C assignments return the value assigned, but Python assignments are just statements, not expressions. Expression statements are often used to run list methods that change a list in place: 123&gt;&gt;&gt; L = L.append(4) # But append returns None, not L&gt;&gt;&gt; print(L) # So we lose our list!None Normally, whether printed output is buffered in memory or not is determined by file; passing a true value to flush forcibly flushes the stream. Because the print statement just sends text to the sys.stdout.write method, you can capture printed text in your programs by assigning sys.stdout to an object whose write method processes the text in arbitrary ways if Tests and Syntax Rules There is no switch or case statement in Python Block and statement boundaries are detected automatically. Compound statements = header + “:” + indented statements. Blank lines, spaces, and comments are usually ignored. Docstrings are ignored but are saved and displayed by tools. Statements may span multiple lines if you’re continuing an open syntactic pair. Boolean operators stop evaluating (“short circuit”) as soon as a result is known. Boolean and and or operators return a true or false object in Python, not the values True or False For A = Y if X else Z, Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false. When defining classes, we can specify their Boolean nature with either the bool or len methods. while and for Loops The optional else block run if didn’t exit loop with break Python doesn’t have what some languages call a “do until” loop statement. Python has no “go to” statement. Python 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as … (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the pass statement, 123&gt;&gt;&gt; X = ... # Alternative to None&gt;&gt;&gt; XEllipsis After the for loop, this loop variable normally still refers to the last item visited, which is the last item in the sequence unless the loop exits with a break statement. Even nested structures may be automatically unpacked this way in a for: 1&gt;&gt;&gt; for ((a, b), c) in [((1, 2), 3), ((4, 5), 6)]: print(a, b, c) In fact, as a general rule, you should resist the temptation to count things in Python—its iteration tools automate much of the work you do to loop over collections in lower-level languages like C. built-in tools: range, zip, enumerate The zip function is more general than this example suggests. For instance, it accepts any type of sequence (really, any iterable object, including files), and it accepts more than two arguments. Moreover, zip truncates result tuples at the length of the shortest sequence when the argument lengths differ. Iterations and Comprehensions Iterator vs. Iterable vs. Iteration tool/context Single scan vs. multiple scan In some cases these two objects are the same when only a single scan is supported (e.g., files), and the iterator object is often temporary, used internally by the iteration tool. Moreover, some objects are both an iteration context tool (they iterate) and an iterable object (their results are iterable)—including Chapter 20’s generator expressions, and map and zip in Python 3.X. When the for loop begins, it first obtains an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the iter built-in function; the object returned by iter in turn has the required next method. The iter function internally runs the iter method, much like next and __next__. For comprehensions, their full syntax allows for any number of for clauses, each of which can have an optional associated if clause. Keep in mind, though, that every built-in tool that scans from left to right across objects uses the iteration protocol. Notice that, unlike map and others, sorted returns an actual list in Python 3.X instead of an iterable. One of the fundamental distinctions of Python 3.X is its stronger emphasis on iterators than 2.X. This, along with its Unicode model and mandated new-style classes, is one of 3.X’s most sweeping changes. Unlike range, map, zip, filter are their own iterators—after you step through their results once, they are exhausted. In Python 3.X the dictionary keys, values, and items methods return iterable view objects that generate result items one at a time. Documentation Interlude The PyDoc system covered here can render a module’s internal documentation as either plain text in a shell, or HTML in a web browser. The help function: press the space bar to move to the next page, Enter to go to the next line, and Q to quit: Sphinx Functions and Generators Function Basics def is executable code. it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other defs. def creates an object and assigns it to a name. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined attributes attached to them to record data. Names are always looked up in scopes—places where variables are stored— and assignments bind names to scopes. Files must generally be rewound (e.g., with a file.seek(0) or another open) after they have been read to end-of-file once, and so are single-pass iterators Scopes When we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term scope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source code determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code. By default, all names assigned inside a function are associated with that function’s namespace, and no other. Lexical scoping: If a variable is assigned inside a def, it is local to that function. If a variable is assigned in an enclosing def, it is nonlocal to nested functions. If a variable is assigned outside all defs, it is global to the entire file. Each module is a global scope, the global scope spans a single file only. Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins. Each call to a function creates a new local scope. Note L=X within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not. Name Resolution: The LEGB Rule Name assignments create or change local names by default. Name references search at most four scopes: local, then enclosing functions (if any), then global, then built-in. Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes, respectively. Note that the second scope lookup layer, E—the scopes of enclosing defs or lambdas—can technically correspond to more than one lookup level. Also keep in mind that these rules apply only to simple variable names (e.g., spam). Qualified attribute names (e.g., object.spam) live in particular objects and follow a completely different set of lookup rules than those covered here. There are technically three more scopes in Python—temporary loop variables in some comprehensions, exception reference variables in some try handlers, and local scopes in class statements In 3.X, the loop variables are local to the expression itself in all comprehension forms: generator, list, set, and dictionary. In 2.X, they are local to generator expressions and set and dictionary compressions, but not to list comprehensions that map their names to the scope outside the expression. By contrast, for loop statements never localize their variables to the statement block in any Python. In 3.X, exception reference variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!). Although the LEGB rule is used to resolve names used in both the top level of a class itself as well as the top level of method functions nested within it, classes themselves are skipped by scope lookups—their names must be fetched as object attributes. The global/nonlocal Statement The global statement consists of the keyword global, followed by one or more names separated by commas. All the listed names will be mapped to the enclosing module’s scope when assigned or referenced within the function body. 1global x The name x do not need even exist in the enclosing module before the function runs; in this case, the first assignment in the function creates x in the module. If, on the other hand, X is declared nonlocal within the function in 3.X (only), the assignment changes the name X in the closest enclosing function’s local scope. The name X must have been defined in at least one enclosing function. 123456def f1():x = 88def f2(x=x): # Remember enclosing scope X with defaultsprint(x)f2()f1() # Prints 88 Because the second x is evaluated before Python steps into the nested def, it still refers to the x in f1. 1234def func():x = 4action = (lambda n, x=x: x ** n) # Pass x in manuallyreturn action Loop variables may require defaults, not scopes, Compare 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; def makeActions():acts = []for i in range(5): # Tries to remember each iacts.append(lambda x: i ** x) # But all remember same last i!return acts with 12345&gt;&gt;&gt; def makeActions():acts = []for i in range(5): # Use defaults insteadacts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x) # Remember current ireturn acts Because defaults are implemented as single objects attached to functions, mutable defaults retain state from call to call, rather than being initialized anew on each call. Unlike global, nonlocal names must already exist in the enclosing function’s scope when declared. In fact, they are checked at function definition time before either an enclosing or nested function is called. Nonlocal both allows assignment to names in enclosing function scopes and limits scope lookups for such names to enclosing defs. Python uses naming conventions in both 2.X and 3.X that ensure that the arbitrary names you assign as function attributes won’t clash with names related to internal implementation. To summarize: globals, nonlocals, classes, and function attributes all offer changeable state-retention options. Arguments In Python 2.X, it’s also possible to automatically unpack tuples in arguments passed to a function. 1def f((a,(b,c))) This def syntax is no longer supported in Python 3.X. Instead, code this function as: 1def f(T): (a, (b, c)) = T Tuple unpacking argument syntax is also disallowed by 3.X in lambda function argument lists. Somewhat asymmetrically, tuple unpacking assignment is still automatic in 3.X for loops targets By default, arguments are matched by position, from left to right, and you must pass exactly as many arguments as there are argument names in the function header. In a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments or the *iterable form, followed by any keyword arguments or the **dict form. If we see *iterable and **dict as being unpacked to positional arguments and keyword arguments, the order becomes: any positional arguments, followed by any keyword arguments. In a broad sense, there are only two arguments: positional and keyword. 123456def foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g): print(&apos;ok&apos;)b=[2]x = &#123;&apos;d&apos;:4,&apos;e&apos;:5&#125;y = &#123;&apos;f&apos;:6&#125;foo(1,*b,3,**x,g=7,**y) //ok In a function header, we use the term “parameter” instead of “argument” In a function header, parameters must appear in this order: any normal parameter(name); followed by any default parameters (name=value); followed by the *name (or * in 3.X) form; followed by any name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form We can use a * character by itself in the arguments list to indicate that a function does not accept a variable-length argument list but still expects all arguments following the * to be passed as keywords. The name=value form has two meaning: before the form *name, it’s positional with default value after the form *name, it’s keyword-only with default value There can be at most one *name parameter, which collects all remaining positional arguments (including those in *iterabe). Similarly, There can be at most one **dict parameter, which collects all remaining keyword arguments (including those in **dict arguments). 12345def foo(a,b=3,*c,d,**e): print(b,e)x = [3,4]y = &#123;&apos;d&apos;:5,&apos;e&apos;:6,&apos;f&apos;:7&#125;foo(1,2,*x,**y) # 2 &#123;&apos;e&apos;: 6, &apos;f&apos;: 7&#125; The steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before assignment can roughly be described as follows: Assign nonkeyword arguments by position. Assign keyword arguments by matching names. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header. Note that in both function call and header, the name = value form are not assignments. The default parameters are attached to function objects, if you code a default to be a mutable object (e.g., def f(a=[])), the same, single mutable object is reused every time the function is later called—even if it is changed in place within the function. Below is a tracer function example: 123def tracer(func, *pargs, **kargs): # Accept arbitrary arguments print(&apos;calling:&apos;, func.__name__) return func(*pargs, **kargs) # Pass along arbitrary arguments Advanced Function Topics In fact, recursion is not used nearly as often in Python as in more esoteric languages like Prolog or Lisp, because Python emphasizes simpler procedural statements like loops, which are usually more natural. On the other hand, recursion—or equivalent explicit stack-based algorithms we’ll meet shortly—can be required to traverse arbitrarily shaped structures. Also note that standard Python limits the depth of its runtime call stack—crucial to recursive call programs—to trap infinite recursion errors. To expand it, use the sys module: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default1000&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting&gt;&gt;&gt; help(sys.setrecursionlimit) # Read more about it Function attributes and annotations 12&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__code__&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__code__.co_varnames Python’s own implementation-related data stored on functions follows naming conventions that prevent them from clashing with the more arbitrary attribute names you might assign yourself. In 3.X, all function internals’ names have leading and trailing double underscores (“__X__”); Attributes are related to objects instead of scopes (and must be referenced through the function name within its code). Python provides special syntax for specifying annotations, but it doesn’t do anything with them itself; annotations are completely optional, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s annotations attribute for use by other tools. Syntactically, function annotations are coded in def header lines, as arbitrary expressions associated with arguments and return values. 123456&gt;&gt;&gt; def func(a: &apos;spam&apos;, b: (1, 10), c: float) -&gt; int:return a + b + c&gt;&gt;&gt; func(1, 2, 3)6&gt;&gt;&gt; func.__annotations__&#123;&apos;c&apos;: &lt;class &apos;float&apos;&gt;, &apos;b&apos;: (1, 10), &apos;a&apos;: &apos;spam&apos;, &apos;return&apos;: &lt;class &apos;int&apos;&gt;&#125; Finally, note that annotations work only in def statements, not lambda expressions. lambda is an expression, not a statement. lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements. Defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def. The code in a lambda body also follows the same scope lookup rules as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope (via the LEGB rule) 12&gt;&gt;&gt; ((lambda x: (lambda y: x + y))(99))(4)103 useful library: functools, operator Comprehensions and Generations map calls can be twice as fast as equivalent for loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than map calls. Generator function vs. Generator vs. Generator expression send advances to the next item yield is now an expression form, it must be enclose in parentheses unless it’s the only item on the right ride of the assignment statement. methods: throw, close yield from Generator expressions may also run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation. A subtle but important point: both generator functions and generator expressions are their own iterators and thus support just one active iteration. Python 3.X localizes loop variables in all four forms—temporary loop variable names in generator, set, dictionary, and list comprehensions are local to the expression. In general, list comprehensions are usually the quickest of the bunch; map beats list comprehensions in Python only when all tools must call functions; for loops tend to be slower than comprehensions; and generator functions and expressions are slower than comprehensions by a constant factor. Under The benchmarking Interlude Timeing modules: time, timer, profile, timeit, pystone.py Part V. Modules and Packages Modules are processed with two statements and one important function: import: Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole from: Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module imp.reload (reload in 2.X): Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python In Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved until such import statements are executed at runtime; their net effect is to assign module names—simple variables like b—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module name used in an import statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external file to be loaded, but it also becomes a variable assigned to the loaded module. Similarly, objects defined by a module are also created at runtime, as the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents. In python, imports perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file: Find the module’s file. Compile it to byte code (if needed). Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines. Bear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named sys.mod ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins. (see imp.reload) Python keeps already imported modules in the built-in sys.modules dictionary so it can keep track of what’s been loaded. Notice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your machine. The Module Search Path Roughly, Python’s module search path is composed of the concatenation of these major components, some of which are preset for you and some of which you can tailor to tell Python where to look: The home directory of the program (subdirectories not included) PYTHONPATH directories (if set) Standard library directories The contents of any .pth files (if present) The site-packages home of third-party extensions Ultimately, the concatenation of these four components becomes sys.path, a mutable list of directory. The first and third elements of the search path are defined automatically. Because Python searches the concatenation of these components from first to last, though, the second and fourth elements can be used to extend the path to include your own source code directories. By modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a program’s run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path—the first per user, and the second per installation. Python automatically selects any type that matches a module’s name. For same names with different extensions, Python follows a standard picking order, though this order is not guaranteed to stay the same over time or across implementations. By using import hooks, archived files are automatically extracted at import time when a .zip file is selected from the module import search path. For details, see the builtin importlib.__import__ function Third-party extensions for Python typically use the distutils tools in the standard library to automatically install themselves, so no path configuration is required to use their code. Systems that use distutils generally come with a setup.py script, which is run to install them; this script imports and uses distutils modules to place such systems in a directory that is automatically part of the module search path (usually in the Lib\\site-packages subdirectory of the Python install tree, wherever that resides on the target machine). Module Coding Basics Module Filenames The .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported. In fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in package imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented. import fetches the module as a whole, so you must qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, from fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module. In Python 3.X, the from …* statement form described here can be used only at the top level of a module file, not within a function. Just like def, import and from are executable statements, not compile-time declarations. They may be nested in if tests, to select among options; appear in function defs, to be loaded only on calls (subject to the preceding note); be used in try statements, to provide defaults; and so on. 123&gt;&gt;&gt; from small import x, y # Copy two names out&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 42 # Changes local x only&gt;&gt;&gt; y[0] = 42 # Changes shared mutable in place At least conceptually, a from statement like this one: 1from module import name1, name2 # Copy these two names out (only) is equivalent to this statement sequence: 1234import module # Fetch the module objectname1 = module.name1 # Copy names out by assignmentname2 = module.name2del module # Get rid of the module name The from always imports the entire module into memory if it has not yet been imported, regardless of how many names it copies out of the file. There is no way to load just part of a module file. Moreover, the from module import * form really can corrupt namespaces and make names difficult to understand, especially when applied to more than one file. Probably the best real-world advice here is to generally prefer import to from for simple modules, to explicitly list the variables you want in most from statements, and to limit the from * form to just one import per file. The as extension works in both import and from as a simple renaming tool. In fact, internally, module namespaces are stored as dictionary objects. The LEGB scope rule applies only to bare, unqualified names—it may be used for the leftmost name in a name path, but later names after dots search specific objects instead. lexical scoping notion—in Python, the scopes surrounding a piece of code are completely determined by the code’s physical position in your file. Scopes are never influenced by function calls or module imports. import operations never give upward visibility to code in imported files —an imported file cannot see names in the importing file. In some sense, although imports do not nest namespaces upward, they do nest downward. 1print(mod2.mod3.X) # Nested mod3&apos;s X Reloading Modules The reload function forces an already loaded module’s code to be reloaded and rerun. Assignments in the file’s new code change the existing module object in place. Note that reload currently only works on modules written in Python; Because reload expects an object, a module must have been previously imported successfully before you can reload it. When you call reload, Python rereads the module file’s source code and reruns its toplevel statements. Perhaps the most important thing to know about reload is that it changes a module object in place; it does not delete and re-create the module object. Reloads impact all clients that use import to fetch modules Reloads impact future from clients only. Clients that used from to fetch attributes in the past won’t be affected by a reload; they’ll still have references to the old objects fetched before the reload. Reloads apply to a single module only. You must run them on each module you wish to update, unless you use code or tools that apply reloads transitively. Module Packages Dotted package from package import item: the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable. import item.subitem.subitem: each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can’t be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item. Tow kinds of imports: absolute imports relative imports In sum, Python imports select between relative (in the containing directory) and absolute (in a directory on sys.path) resolutions as follows: Dotted imports: from . import m Are relative-only in both 2.X and 3.X Nondotted imports: import m, from m import x Are relative-then-absolute in 2.X, and absolute-only in 3.X Note that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always “main”, modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports. Python 3.3 adds another flavor to modules: namespace packages. Packages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a __path__ attribute is considered a package. Two kinds of packages: regular packages namespace packages"},{"title":"网络编程","date":"2018-07-27T16:23:23.000Z","updated":"2018-07-27T15:58:40.000Z","comments":true,"path":"Languages/python/python网络编程.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/Languages/python/python网络编程.html","excerpt":"杂记： 网卡一般是双工的，上行下行可同时发生，传输是以字节Byte为最小单位（本质上传输的是比特流）。","text":"杂记： 网卡一般是双工的，上行下行可同时发生，传输是以字节Byte为最小单位（本质上传输的是比特流）。"},{"title":"","date":"2018-09-09T15:59:18.000Z","updated":"2018-09-09T15:59:18.000Z","comments":true,"path":"Languages/python/Python resources.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/Languages/python/Python resources.html","excerpt":"a web crawler with asyncio coroutines This articles explains in details the internals of generators, coroutines, Future, Task, Eventloop.","text":"a web crawler with asyncio coroutines This articles explains in details the internals of generators, coroutines, Future, Task, Eventloop."},{"title":"notes for Fluent Python","date":"2019-08-18T01:16:49.000Z","updated":"2019-08-18T01:16:49.000Z","comments":true,"path":"Languages/python/notes for flunet python.html","permalink":"https://guyong.xyz/Languages/python/notes for flunet python.html","excerpt":"immutable: number, string, tuple, bytes mutable: list, dict, set, byte array sequence: list, string string vs. bytes vs. byte array In each iteration of for i in a:, i get a copy of the current element * modifying i doesn’t affect a, i.e. i is not a lvalue reference of a[] * usea[:] as a copy o","text":"immutable: number, string, tuple, bytes mutable: list, dict, set, byte array sequence: list, string string vs. bytes vs. byte array In each iteration of for i in a:, i get a copy of the current element modifying i doesn’t affect a, i.e. i is not a lvalue reference of a[] usea[:] as a copy of a if you need to modify the sequence default argument is evaluated only once at the point of function definition in the defining scope. set may contain duplicate elements while dict may not.

The first oracle answers the number of paths for a planar DAG; the second answers the number of shortest paths for a planar graph (directed or undirected) with positive edge weights. Both oracles take $O(n^{1.5})$ preprocessing time, $O(n^{1.5})$ space and $O(\\\\sqrt{n})$ query time. The results can be extended to other graphs that admit small balanced separators. The first oracle can be used to improve the time of counting the number of minimum $(s,t)$-cuts in planar and bounded genus graphs (the last paragraph of the main content).\\n\\nFor the first oracle, the algorithm works in a divide-and-conquer manner. It first computes a separator $(A,B,C)$ with no edges between $A$ and $B$ and only $O(\\\\sqrt{n})$ vertices in $C$. Then all paths are divided into two classes: those intersecting $C$ and those don't. The latter can be handled by recursion on $A$ and $B$. The former are divided according to the specific first intersecting vertex in $C$. The algorithm uses vertices in $C$ as intermediaries. For each $c\\\\in C$, it computes and stores the cardinality of two sets: the set of $s-c$ paths which intersects $C$ first at $c$ and the set of $c-t$ paths. Then the number of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ is the product of those two cardinality because there is a bijection between the set of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ and the Cartesian product of those two sets (which is the main technical aspect of their contribution). Therefore, the number of $s-t$ paths intersecting $C$ can be computed by summing over all $c\\\\in C$ in the query procedure.\\n\\nThe algorithm for the second oracle works similarly. It computes shortest paths instead of all paths, stores the weights of those paths as well as the number of them. In the query procedure, it counts only those paths having the shortest weights. Note that the similar bijection doesn't hold for all those sub-paths, but holds for those achieving the shortest weights, which is exactly what the query procedure requires to count.\\n\\n[Overall assessment] This paper initiate the study on counting oracles for various paths. The first result can be used to improve the time of counting minimum $s-t$-cuts in planar and bounded genus graphs. It's interesting to known whether there are other applications since the algorithms are sort of restricted.\\n\\n------------------------\\nSome more specific comments:\\n- At the beginning of section 1.1, the first two works are only for planar graphs.\\n- Algorithm 1 only applies to undirected graphs with positive edge weights. It applies to digraphs by a trivial modification. \\n- In lemma 3, the time should be $T(n)+O(m)$, since the algorithm is not restricted to planar graphs. Section 5 has the same problem.\\n- In section 5, the solutions to some recurrences are wrong. \\n- There are a few typos such as: \\n 1. \\\"the separator\\\" -> \\\"the separator C\\\" in section 3\\n 2. \\\"CONSTRUCTORACLE\\\" -> \\\"CONSTRUCTSHORTESTPATHORACLE\\\" in Alg. 4. \\n 3. \\\"positive edge weights\\\" and \\\"shortest\\\" should be added in Theorem 14\\n\\n\\n## 2.\\nResults apply to both undirected graphs and digraphs, can be extended to multigraphs. \\n\\nAlgorithm 1 only applies to \\\"positively weighted undirected graphs\\\". It applies to directed graphs by removing the \\\"else if\\\" segment.\\n\\nLemma 3, the running time should be $T(n)+O(m)$, unless it's restricted to plannar graphs.\\n\\n`CountPath(G,u)`: G is a DAG \\n`CountShortestPath(G,u)`: G is positively weighted.\\n\\n## 3.\\nLemma 7, note that the condition \\\"G is a DAG\\\", to be checked again.\\n\\nThe algorithm computes an oracle answering the number of paths between any two veritces in a plannar DAG. It takes $O(n^{1.5})$ time and $O(n^{1.5})$ space to construct and answers each query in time $O(\\\\sqrt{n})$. The algorithm works in a divide-and-conquer manner. It first computes a balanced separator $(A,B,C)$. Then all paths are divided to two classes: those intersecting C and those don't. The latter can be counted by recurrsion. It remains to count the former.\\n\\nThe former are divided according to the specific first intersecting vertex in C. For every pair $(s,t)$, the algorithm computes and stores for each $c\\\\in C$ the number of simple paths from $s$ to $c$, which intersects $C$ first at $c$, and the number of simple paths from $c$ to $t$. Then the number of paths intersecting $C$ first at $c$ is the product of them. Therefore, the number of paths intersecting C can be computed by summing over all $c\\\\in C$.\\n\\n> In lemma 7, it's G is DAG that makes the concatenation of $s-c$ sub-path and $c-t$ sub-path work, i.e. the resulted $s-c-t$ path is a \\\"simple\\\" path.\\n\\n## 4.\\nThe second algorithm computes an oracle answering the number of shortest paths between any two vertices in a plannar graph (directed or undirected) with positive edge weights. The algorithms costs the same resources as the first one. It also works as similar as it with small modification. In the construction procedure, it computes and stores the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $c$ and from $c$ to $t$ instead of all the paths. Meanwhile, it also records the weights of those paths.

(Not for ES6, in which promise has *built-in async support.*{.b} \\n\\nES6在事件队列（macroqueue)的基础上，增加了一个任务队列（microqueue)。 microqueue的优先级更高，js引擎每处理完一个macroqueue事件，它都会优先处理所有的microqueue中的事件，等microqueue中的事件处理完后再处理macroqueue中的下一个事件。 \\n```js\\nfunction promisify(v){\\n return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log(v)\\n resolve(v+2)\\n console.log(v+1)\\n })\\n}\\n\\nlet p = promisify(0)\\nconsole.log('-2')\\nsetTimeout(()=>{\\n console.log('-1')\\n},0)\\np.then((v)=>{\\n promisify(v)\\n})\\n// 0 1 -2 2 3 -1\\n```\\n\\nProblems with callback\\n1. 非线性，难理解，易出错\\n2. 信任问题，控制反转\\n * 过早调用 （Zalgo风险）\\n * 过晚调用（或不调用)\\n * 调用次数过多或过少\\n * 未能传递所需的环境或参数\\n * 吞掉可能出现的错误和异常\\n\\n> Promise并没有摈弃回调，只是把回调的安排转交给了一个位于我们和其它工具之间的可信任的中介机制。\\n\\nSome notes for `promise`:\\n1. 流程控制\\n2. 注册事件\\n3. 如何调度的:同一promise的then调用顺序？不同promise的then调用顺序？\\n4. 由于promise决议后只能有一个值（或一个拒绝理由), resolve/reject 只接受一个参数，其它参数会被忽略(`{tc-b} 避免传递参数混乱`)。多次调用resolve 也会只执行第一个（*避免过多调用*{.b}）。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(v){\\n return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log(v)\\n resolve(v+1,v+2)\\n resolve(v+3,v+4)\\n })\\n}\\n\\nlet p = promisify(0)\\np.then((v,w)=>{\\n console.log(v,w)\\n})\\n//0 1\\n```\\n5. Promise 把整个操作（包括异常）变成了异步，避免了Zalgo风险. 从而使得`then`可以在‘操作’的后面提供 resolve/reject 参数. 注意，构造promise时，虽然 resolve/reject 是以参数形式存在，但是可以自由使用它们。以下面的promisify为例：\\n```js\\nfunction request(url){\\n\\treturn new Promise( function(resolve,reject){\\n \\tajax(url,resolve);\\n });\\n}\\n```\\najax函数是立即执行的，它可以把 （此时空的）resolve 当作回调。然而，当ajax函数异步完成后需要调用 resolve 时，Promise机制可以保证 resolve的调用顺利地进行。如何保证？首先ajax是异步调用resolve的，即使把ajax换成同步函数，promise也会使其异步化（*避免过早调用*{.b}），这样可以保证在request同一个tick中，通过then得到的resolve都是已经准备就绪的。注意，即使不在同一个tick中注册的resolve函数也会被顺利执行(*避免过晚或过少调用*{.b}）。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(val){\\n return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){\\n console.log(val);\\n resolve();\\n })\\n}\\nconsole.log(1)\\nlet p = promisify(2)\\nconsole.log(3)\\n\\nlet q = promisify(4)\\nlet z = q.then(()=>{\\n console.log(7)\\n return p.then(()=>{\\n console.log(9)\\n })\\n})\\nconsole.log(5)\\np.then(()=>{\\n console.log(8)\\n})\\nconsole.log(6)\\n//1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\\n```\\n\\n6. Promise.resolve() 会展开thenable的值,从而得到可信任的promise。若传入的参数是真正的promise, Promise.resilve() 什么都不会做，只会直接返回这个参数。\\n7. resolve和reject的返回值会作为then返回的新promise的决议值。resolve/reject都可以得到新的未决议的promise (可能fullfill,也可能reject). 注意区分当前promise和then得到的新promise, 当前reject，但then得到的新promise是既可以fullfill又可以reject的。\\n然而，`new Promise`中的 resolve/reject则不同。 若提供的参数是promise, resolve会展开它，决议值是该参数promise的决议值（可能是完成的也可能是拒绝的）。而reject的决议值则只能是拒绝的。因此 `new Promise( function(resolve,reject){})` 中的 resolve 确实是“决议” （而非完成）的意思。而then方法中最好理解为 `then(fulfilled, rejected)`. 前者中resolve/reject 是形参，后者中 fulfilled/rejected 是实参。\\n\\n8. then未提供resolve或reject时，默认的resolve/reject会把当前决议值（或拒绝理由）传递下去。`catch(err){}` 则是`then(null, function(err){})` 的缩写。\\n9. promise chain中的错误（异常或reject)可以通过在chain的末端加一个`catch()`来处理，如果中间的then没有rejected处理，那么默认的rejected函数会将该错误往下传。唯一的问题是最后的catch仍返回一个可能出错的promise，这个问题ES6本身没有提供解决方案。\\n\\n## `new Promise()`\\n1. `new Promise(function(resolve,reject){})` 中形参resolve/reject对应的实参是 Promise.resolve/Promise.reject. 以下两种构造是等价的\\n```js\\nlet p =new Promise(function(resolve,reject){resolve(1);});\\nlet q = Promise.resolve(1);\\n```\\n2. `new Promise()` 中的代码是立即执行的（当前tick)， 其中的resolve/reject语句是异步执行的，其它语句（之前和之后的）可以看作是同步的。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(v){\\n return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log(v)\\n resolve(v+2)\\n console.log(v+1)\\n })\\n}\\n\\nlet p = promisify(0)\\n\\np.then((v)=>{\\n console.log(v)\\n})\\n// 0 1 2\\n```\\n3. `new Promise(null)` 并不会返回一个rejected promise, 而是抛出异常。因为promise构造过程中出现异常会使得promise构造失败。\\n\\n## `then`方法\\n1. 调用promise的`then()` 会自动创建一个新的promise从调用返回\\n2. 在then的resolve/reject内部，如果返回一个值或抛出一个异常，新返回的promise就相应地决议为该值.\\n3. 如果resolve/reject 返回一个promise, 它将会被*展开*{.r}，不管它的决议值是什么，都会成为then返回的新promise的决议值。(新返回的promise的决议值是那个promise展开后的值，不是那个promise本身）\\n\\n## 其它API\\n`all`, `race`, `none`, `any`, `first`, `last`\\n\\n### Promise局限性\\n1. promise chain返回的是最后一个promise, 没有保存中间promise的引用，无法在外面给中间的promise关联处理函数。若中间的promise有自己的错误处理，则最后的promise不会得到错误的通知 （除非中间的错误处理函数继续产生拒绝）。这与`try...catch...`类似。\\n2. promise只能决议为单一值，需要多个值的话可以封闭成单个值，但是在复杂的场景中会比较笨重。一种方法是可以分解成多个promise后用promise.all来处理。\\n3. promise只能决议一次，不能像监听事件一样，事件每发生一次相应的监听函数就会被调用一次。一种方法是每次事件触发后构造一个新的promise.\\n4. 已有代码大都基于回调，需要手动promisify. 可以编写类似于`Promise.wrap()`的函数来解决，该wrap函数返回一个promisory. promisory调用才返回一个promise. 例如 `let request = Promise.wrap(ajax);` ES6并未提供类似的wrap函数。\\n5. promise无法取消。一种方法是用“门” 来hack. 单独的promise不应该可取消，但是取消一个promise chain是合理的。\\n\\n## Promise/A+\\n[The official specification](https://promisesaplus.com)\\n\\nA 'promise' is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this

Promise 把整个操作（包括异常）变成了异步，避免了Zalgo风险. 从而使得`then`可以在‘操作’的后面提供 resolve/reject 参数. 注意，构造promise时，虽然 resolve/reject 是以参数形式存在，但是可以自由使用它们。以下面的promisify为例：\\n```js\\nfunction request(url){\\n\\treturn new Promise( function(resolve,reject){\\n \\tajax(url,resolve);\\n });\\n}\\n```\\najax函数是立即执行的，它可以把 （此时空的）resolve 当作回调。然而，当ajax函数异步完成后需要调用 resolve 时，Promise机制可以保证 resolve的调用顺利地进行。如何保证？首先ajax是异步调用resolve的，即使把ajax换成同步函数，promise也会使其异步化（==避免过早调用==），这样可以保证在request同一个tick中，通过then得到的resolve都是已经准备就绪的。注意，即使不在同一个tick中注册的resolve函数也会被顺利执行(==避免过晚或过少调用==）。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(val){\\n return new Promise(function(resolve,reject){\\n console.log(val);\\n resolve();\\n })\\n}\\nconsole.log(1)\\nlet p = promisify(2)\\nconsole.log(3)\\n\\nlet q = promisify(4)\\nlet z = q.then(()=>{\\n console.log(7)\\n return p.then(()=>{\\n console.log(9)\\n })\\n})\\nconsole.log(5)\\np.then(()=>{\\n console.log(8)\\n})\\nconsole.log(6)\\n//1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\\n```\\n\\n6. Promise.resolve() 会展开thenable的值,从而得到可信任的promise。若传入的参数是真正的promise, Promise.resolve() 什么都不会做，只会直接返回这个参数。\\n7. resolve和reject的返回值会作为then返回的新promise的决议值。resolve/reject都可以得到新的未决议的promise (可能fullfill,也可能reject). 注意区分当前promise和then得到的新promise, 当前reject，但then得到的新promise是既可以fullfill又可以reject的。\\n然而，`new Promise`中的 resolve/reject则不同。 若提供的参数是promise, resolve会展开它，决议值是该参数promise的决议值（可能是完成的也可能是拒绝的）。而reject的决议值则只能是拒绝的。因此 `new Promise( function(resolve,reject){})` 中的 resolve 确实是“决议” （而非完成）的意思。而then方法中最好理解为 `then(fulfilled, rejected)`. 前者中resolve/reject 是形参，后者中 fulfilled/rejected 是实参。\\n\\n8. then未提供resolve或reject时，默认的resolve/reject会把当前决议值（或拒绝理由）传递下去。`catch(err){}` 则是`then(null, function(err){})` 的缩写。\\n9. promise chain中的错误（异常或reject)可以通过在chain的末端加一个`catch()`来处理，如果中间的then没有rejected处理，那么默认的rejected函数会将该错误往下传。唯一的问题是最后的catch仍返回一个可能出错的promise，这个问题ES6本身没有提供解决方案。\\n\\n## `new Promise()`\\n1. `new Promise(function(resolve,reject){})` 中形参resolve/reject对应的实参是 Promise.resolve/Promise.reject. 以下两种构造是等价的\\n```js\\nlet p =new Promise(function(resolve,reject){resolve(1);});\\nlet q = Promise.resolve(1);\\n```\\n2. `new Promise()` 中的代码是立即执行的（当前tick)， 其中的resolve/reject语句是异步执行的，其它语句（之前和之后的）可以看作是同步的。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(v){\\n return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log(v)\\n resolve(v+2)\\n console.log(v+1)\\n })\\n}\\n\\nlet p = promisify(0)\\n\\np.then((v)=>{\\n console.log(v)\\n})\\n// 0 1 2\\n```\\n3. `new Promise(null)` 并不会返回一个rejected promise, 而是抛出异常。因为promise构造过程中出现异常会使得promise构造失败。\\n\\n## `then`方法\\n1. 调用promise的`then()` 会自动创建一个新的promise从调用返回\\n2. 在then的resolve/reject内部，如果返回一个值或抛出一个异常，新返回的promise就相应地决议为该值.\\n3. 如果resolve/reject 返回一个promise, 它将会被==展开==，不管它的决议值是什么，都会成为then返回的新promise的决议值。(新返回的promise的决议值是那个promise展开后的值，不是那个promise本身）\\n\\n## 其它API\\n`all`, `race`, `none`, `any`, `first`, `last`\\n\\n### Promise局限性\\n1. promise chain返回的是最后一个promise, 没有保存中间promise的引用，无法在外面给中间的promise关联处理函数。若中间的promise有自己的错误处理，则最后的promise不会得到错误的通知 （除非中间的错误处理函数继续产生拒绝）。这与`try...catch...`类似。\\n2. promise只能决议为单一值，需要多个值的话可以封闭成单个值，但是在复杂的场景中会比较笨重。一种方法是可以分解成多个promise后用promise.all来处理。\\n3. promise只能决议一次，不能像监听事件一样，事件每发生一次相应的监听函数就会被调用一次。一种方法是每次事件触发后构造一个新的promise.\\n4. 已有代码大都基于回调，需要手动promisify. 可以编写类似于`Promise.wrap()`的函数来解决，该wrap函数返回一个promisory. promisory调用才返回一个promise. 例如 `let request = Promise.wrap(ajax);` ES6并未提供类似的wrap函数。\\n5. promise无法取消。一种方法是用“门” 来hack. 单独的promise不应该可取消，但是取消一个promise chain是合理的。\\n\\n## Promise/A+\\n[The official specification](https://promisesaplus.com)\\n\\nA 'promise' is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\\n\\nA promise must be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\\n\\nWhen pending, a promise:\\n* may transition to either the fulfilled or rejected state.\\n\\nWhen fulfilled, a promise:\\n* must not transition to any other state.\\n* must have a value, which must not change.\\nWhen rejected, a promise:\\n* must not transition to any other state.\\n* must have a reason, which must not change.\\n\\nHere, “must not change” means immutable identity (i.e. ===), but does not imply deep immutability.\\n\\nA promise must provide a then method to access its current or eventual value or reason.\\n\\nA promise’s then method accepts two arguments (both are optional, non-function are ignored):\\n```\\npromise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)\\n```\\n`then` must return a promise\\n```js\\n'use strict';\\nvar p1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log('p1 creating...'); //execute immediately\\n reject('rejecting'); //transit to fulfilled\\n resolve('resolving'); //invalid\\n console.log('p1 created'); //execute immediately\\n});\\nconsole.log(typeof p1); //object\\nconsole.log(p1);\\np1.then(function (result) {\\n console.log(result)\\n}, function (err) {\\n console.log(err)\\n});\\n```\\noutput:\\n```\\np1 creating...\\np1 created\\nobject\\nPromise { 'rejecting' }\\nrejecting\\n```\\n\",[[1565786741147,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,2829,\"\\n7. \"]],[2825,2825],[2829,2829]]],[1565786743128,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,2826,\"7. \"]],[2829,2829],[2826,2826]]]],null,\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\"],[\"17af5065-7d27-40d2-bdb2-41762a3e9bee\",1565787313974,\"# References\\n[Javascript promise, under the hood.](https://medium.com/@ningxia/javascript-promises-under-the-hood-4ce853fcb2c9)\\n\\nThis article illustrate how promise works by writing its own promise library squab.

Promise.resolve() 会展开thenable的值,从而得到可信任的promise。若传入的参数是真正的promise, Promise.resolve() 什么都不会做，只会直接返回这个参数。\\n\\n7. resolve和reject的返回值会作为then返回的新promise的决议值。resolve/reject都可以得到新的未决议的promise (可能fullfill,也可能reject). 注意区分当前promise和then得到的新promise, 当前reject，但then得到的新promise是既可以fullfill又可以reject的。\\n然而，`new Promise`中的 resolve/reject则不同。 若提供的参数是promise, resolve会展开它，决议值是该参数promise的决议值（可能是完成的也可能是拒绝的）。而reject的决议值则只能是拒绝的。因此 `new Promise( function(resolve,reject){})` 中的 resolve 确实是“决议” （而非完成）的意思。而then方法中最好理解为 `then(fulfilled, rejected)`. 前者中resolve/reject 是形参，后者中 fulfilled/rejected 是实参。\\n\\n8. then未提供resolve或reject时，默认的resolve/reject会把当前决议值（或拒绝理由）传递下去。`catch(err){}` 则是`then(null, function(err){})` 的缩写。\\n9. promise chain中的错误（异常或reject)可以通过在chain的末端加一个`catch()`来处理，如果中间的then没有rejected处理，那么默认的rejected函数会将该错误往下传。唯一的问题是最后的catch仍返回一个可能出错的promise，这个问题ES6本身没有提供解决方案。\\n\\n## `new Promise()`\\n1. `new Promise(function(resolve,reject){})` 中形参resolve/reject对应的实参是 Promise.resolve/Promise.reject. 以下两种构造是等价的\\n```js\\nlet p =new Promise(function(resolve,reject){resolve(1);});\\nlet q = Promise.resolve(1);\\n```\\n2. `new Promise()` 中的代码是立即执行的（当前tick)， 其中的resolve/reject语句是异步执行的，其它语句（之前和之后的）可以看作是同步的。\\n```js\\nfunction promisify(v){\\n return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log(v)\\n resolve(v+2)\\n console.log(v+1)\\n })\\n}\\n\\nlet p = promisify(0)\\n\\np.then((v)=>{\\n console.log(v)\\n})\\n// 0 1 2\\n```\\n3. `new Promise(null)` 并不会返回一个rejected promise, 而是抛出异常。因为promise构造过程中出现异常会使得promise构造失败。\\n\\n## `then`方法\\n1. 调用promise的`then()` 会自动创建一个新的promise从调用返回\\n2. 在then的resolve/reject内部，如果返回一个值或抛出一个异常，新返回的promise就相应地决议为该值.\\n3. 如果resolve/reject 返回一个promise, 它将会被==展开==，不管它的决议值是什么，都会成为then返回的新promise的决议值。(新返回的promise的决议值是那个promise展开后的值，不是那个promise本身）\\n\\n## 其它API\\n`all`, `race`, `none`, `any`, `first`, `last`\\n\\n### Promise局限性\\n1. promise chain返回的是最后一个promise, 没有保存中间promise的引用，无法在外面给中间的promise关联处理函数。若中间的promise有自己的错误处理，则最后的promise不会得到错误的通知 （除非中间的错误处理函数继续产生拒绝）。这与`try...catch...`类似。\\n2. promise只能决议为单一值，需要多个值的话可以封闭成单个值，但是在复杂的场景中会比较笨重。一种方法是可以分解成多个promise后用promise.all来处理。\\n3. promise只能决议一次，不能像监听事件一样，事件每发生一次相应的监听函数就会被调用一次。一种方法是每次事件触发后构造一个新的promise.\\n4. 已有代码大都基于回调，需要手动promisify. 可以编写类似于`Promise.wrap()`的函数来解决，该wrap函数返回一个promisory. promisory调用才返回一个promise. 例如 `let request = Promise.wrap(ajax);` ES6并未提供类似的wrap函数。\\n5. promise无法取消。一种方法是用“门” 来hack. 单独的promise不应该可取消，但是取消一个promise chain是合理的。\\n\\n## Promise/A+\\n[The official specification](https://promisesaplus.com)\\n\\nA 'promise' is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\\n\\nA promise must be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\\n\\nWhen pending, a promise:\\n* may transition to either the fulfilled or rejected state.\\n\\nWhen fulfilled, a promise:\\n* must not transition to any other state.\\n* must have a value, which must not change.\\nWhen rejected, a promise:\\n* must not transition to any other state.\\n* must have a reason, which must not change.\\n\\nHere, “must not change” means immutable identity (i.e. ===), but does not imply deep immutability.\\n\\nA promise must provide a then method to access its current or eventual value or reason.\\n\\nA promise’s then method accepts two arguments (both are optional, non-function are ignored):\\n```\\npromise.then(onFulfilled, onRejected)\\n```\\n`then` must return a promise\\n```js\\n'use strict';\\nvar p1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {\\n console.log('p1 creating...');

Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of obj \\n\\nThe Python Conceptual Hierarchy:\\n1. Programs are composed of modules.\\n2. Modules contain statements.\\n3. Statements contain expressions.\\n4. Expressions create and process objects.\\n\\n![Table 4-1](../.pastes/2018-09-03-12-05-36.png)\\nIn formal terms, this means that Python is dynamically typed , a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also strongly typed, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type.\\n\\n## Core Types\\nImmutable: number, string, tuple, bytes \\nMutable: list, dictionary, set, bytearray\\n\\nPrimitive: number \\nCollection:\\n* Sequence: string, tuple, bytes, list, bytearray\\n* Mapping: dictionary, set\\n\\nbytearray is a distinct hybrid of immutable bytes strings (whose b'...' syntax is required in 3.X and optional in 2.X) and mutable lists (coded and displayed in [] ).\\n\\ngeneric operations that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g. `len(X)` , `X[0]` ), but type-specific operations are method calls (e.g., `aString.upper()` ).\\n\\nBoth `dir` and `help` also accept as arguments either a real object (like our string S) , or the name of a data type (like str , list , and dict ).\\n\\nAs a notable difference, Python 2.X allows its normal and Unicode strings to be mixed in expressions as long as the normal string is all ASCII; in contrast, Python 3.X has a tighter model that never allows its normal and byte strings to mix without explicit conversion.\\n\\nNone of the string object’s own methods support pattern-based text processing.\\n\\nUnlike out-of-bounds assignments in lists, which are forbidden, assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys, fetching a nonexistent key is still a mistake. (Use the get() method)\\n\\nA file’s contents are always a string in your script, regardless of\\nthe type of data the file contains:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> for line in open('data.txt'): print(line)\\n```\\n\\t\\nText files represent content as normal str strings and perform\\nUnicode encoding and decoding automatically when writing and reading data, while binary files represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered.\\n\\nSets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects.\\nDecimal, Fraction, booleans\\n\\nAs you’ll learn, in Python, we code to object interfaces (operations supported), not to types.\\n\\n## Numbers\\n![Table 5-1](../.pastes/2018-09-03-12-09-34.png)\\n\\nFloating-point numbers are implemented as C “doubles” in standard CPython, and therefore get as much precision as the C compiler used to build the Python interpreter gives to doubles.\\n\\nbuilt-in calls: hex(I), oct(I), bin(I), int(str,base), X.bit_length(),round(X), X.as_integer_ratio()\\n\\nInternally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers\\n\\n![Table 5-2](../.pastes/2018-09-03-12-10-38.png)\\n\\nComparison operators may be chained: X < Y < Z produces the same result as X < Y and Y < Z .\\n```python\\n>>> 1 == 2 < 3 # Same as: 1 == 2 and 2 < 3\\nFalse # Not same as: False < 3 (which means 0 < 3, which is true!)\\n```\\n\\t\\nIn recent Pythons, the slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)].\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons are not allowed and raise exceptions; this includes sorts by proxy.\\n\\n* Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so bind more tightly in mixed expressions.\\n* Operators in the same row in Table 5-2 generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right).\\n\\nBesides mixing operators in expressions, you can also mix numeric types: \\nin mixed-type numeric expressions, Python first converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand, and then performs the math on same-type operands. Python ranks the complexity of numeric types like so: integers are simpler than floating point numbers, which are simpler than complex numbers. \\nIn general, Python does not convert across any other type boundaries automatically. Adding a string to an integer, for example, results in an error, unless you manually convert one or the other.\\n\\n In 3.X, the / now always performs true division, returning a float result that includes any remainder, regardless of operand types. The // performs floor division, which truncates the remainder and returns an integer for integer operands or a float if any operand is a float.\\n\\nThe // operator truncates the result down to its floor, which means the closest whole number below the true result.\\n\\nFrozenset\\n\\nInternally, the names True and False are instances of bool , which is in turn just a subclass (in the object oriented sense) of the built-in integer type int . True and False behave exactly like the integers 1 and 0, except that they have customized printing logic.\\n```\\n>>> True + 4 # (Hmmm)\\n5\\n```\\n\\t\\nNumpy, Scipy\\n\\t\\nThe dynamic typing\\nA variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.\\n\\nVariables always link to objects and never to other variables, but larger objects may link to other objects (for instance, a list object has links to the objects it contains).\\nThese links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory\\n\\nTechnically speaking, objects have more structure than just enough space to represent their values. Each object also has two standard header fields: a type designator used to mark the type of the object, and a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object.\\n\\nreference counter, cyclic reference\\n\\tsys.getrefcount(X)\\n\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in expression, they are copied. e.g. after b=a[:3], b refers to a new object.\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in left side of assignment, they referred to the original object. e.g. after a=[0,1,2] a[:] = [0,1], a becomes [0,1]\\n\\n Because everything seems to work by assignment and references\\nin Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. As you’ll see, it works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python;\\n\\nweakref\\n\\n## String\\n![](../.pastes/2018-09-03-12-13-34.png)\\n\\n![Table 7-1](../.pastes/2018-09-03-16-34-23.png)\\nString literal forms:\\n* Single quotes: 'spa\\\"m'\\n* Double quotes: \\\"spa'm\\\"\\n* Triple quotes: '''... spam ...''' , \\\"\\\"\\\"... spam ...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n* Escape sequences: \\\"s\\\\tp\\\\na\\\\0m\\\"\\n* Raw strings: r\\\"C:\\\\new\\\\test.spm\\\"\\n* Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): b'sp\\\\x01am'\\n* Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): u'eggs\\\\u0020spam'\\n\\nIn fact, 3.X defines str strings formally as sequences of Unicode code\\npoints, not bytes, to make this clear.

Because it can be a bit complex, it is perhaps best thought of as a combination of two steps:\\n1. Deletion. The slice you specify to the left of the = is deleted.\\n2. Insertion. The new items contained in the iterable object to the right of the = are inserted into the list on the left, at the place where the old slice was deleted.\\nNote, L[2:5]=L[3:6], for instance, works fine because the value to be inserted is fetched before the deletion\\nhappens on the left.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1]\\n>>> L[:0] = [2, 3, 4] # Insert all at :0, an empty slice at front\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1]\\n>>> L[len(L):] = [5, 6, 7] # Insert all at len(L):, an empty slice at end\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]\\n>>> L.extend([8, 9, 10]) # Insert all at end, named method\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\n\\t\\nThe effect of `L.append(X)` is similar to `L+[X]`, but while the former changes L in place, the latter makes a new list.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, this has changed: magnitude comparison of mixed types\\nraises an exception instead of falling back on the fixed cross-type ordering.\\n\\nL.sort() vs. sorted\\nbuilt-in tools: reversed\\n\\nLike lists, dictionaries store object references (not copies, unless you ask for them explicitly)\\n\\n![Table 8-2](../.pastes/2018-09-03-12-18-20.png)\\n\\nkeys in 3.X returns an iterable object, instead of a physical list\\nUnlike lists, however, whenever you assign a new dictionary key (one that hasn’t been assigned before) you create a new entry in the dictionary.\\n\\nIn 3.X the dictionary keys , values , and items methods all return view objects , whereas in 2.X they return actual result lists. \\nBesides being iterable, dictionary views also retain the original order of dictionary components, reflect future changes to the dictionary, and may support set operations.

Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X, but they work in 2.X as though comparing sorted (key, value) lists.\\n- Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 < 'spam' ) are errors in Python 3.X. They are allowed in Python 2.X, but use a fixed but arbitrary ordering rule based on type name string. By proxy, this also applies to sorts, which use comparisons internally: nonnumeric mixed-type collections cannot be sorted in 3.X.\\n\\nPython 3.X disallows mixed-type magnitude testing, except numeric types.\\n\\nMore generally, the notions of true and false are intrinsic properties of every object in Python—each object is either true or false, as follows:\\n- Numbers are false if zero, and true otherwise.\\n- Other objects are false if empty, and true otherwise.\\n\\n That is, *None* is something, not nothing (despite its name!)—it is a real object and a real piece of memory that is created and given a built-in name by Python itself.\\n\\n In fact, even types themselves are an object type in Python.\\n Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage.\\n\\nFor classic classes in Python 2.X, all class instances are instead of the type “instance,” and we must compare instance `__class__` attributes to compare their types meaningfully.\\n\\nRepetition Adds One Level Deep\\n```python\\n>>> L = [4, 5, 6]\\n>>> X = L * 4 # Like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...\\n>>> Y = [L] * 4 # [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...]\\n```\\n\\t\\nIf you remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much more sense\\n\\nBeware of Cyclic Data Structure\\n```python\\n>>> L = ['grail'] # Append reference to same object\\n>>> L.append(L) # Generates cycle in object: [...]\\n>>> L\\n['grail', [...]]\\n```\\n\\n# Statements and Syntax\\n## Assignments, Expressions, and Prints\\n- Assignments create object references. (i.e. link a name with an object) They always create references to objects instead of copying the objects.\\n- Names are created when first assigned.\\n- Names must be assigned before referenced.\\n\\nModule imports, function and class definitions, for loop variables, and function arguments are all implicit assignments.\\n\\n![Table 11-1](../.pastes/2018-09-03-13-40-51.png)\\n\\nsequence assignment—any sequence of names can be\\nassigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items one at a time by position. In fact, the original tuple and list assignment forms in Python have been generalized to accept any type of sequence (really, iterable) on the right as long as it is of the same length as the sequence on the left.\\n\\nMultiple-target assignment: Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object farthest to the right) to all the targets on the left.\\n\\nIn tuple/list assignment, Python creates a temporary tuple that saves the original values of the variables on the right before assigning.\\n\\nwe can even assign nested sequences, and Python unpacks their parts according to their shape, as expected. The sequence-nesting shape of the object on the left must match that of the object on the right.\\n> This nested tuple (really, sequence) unpacking\\nassignment form works for function argument lists in Python 2.X (though not in 3.X)\\n\\nIn short, a single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target in order to specify a more general matching against the sequence—the starred name is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names. In fact, the starred name can appear anywhere in the target.\\n> This is similar in spirit to slicing, but not exactly the same—a sequence unpacking assignment always returns a list for multiple matched items, whereas slicing returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced\\n```\\n>>> a, *b = 'spam'\\n>>> a, b\\n('s', ['p', 'a', 'm'])\\n>>> S[0], S[1:] # Slices are type-specific, * assignment always returns a list\\n('s', 'pam')\\n```\\n\\nFinally, errors can still be triggered if there is more than one starred name, if there are too few values and no star (as before), and if the starred name is not itself coded inside a sequence:\\n```\\n>>> *a = seq\\nSyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple\\n```\\n\\nFor augmented assignments, inplace operations may be applied for mutable objects as an optimization.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1, 2]\\n>>> L = L + [3] # Concatenate: slower\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> L.append(4) # Faster, but in place\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\n>>> L += [9, 10] # Mapped to L.extend([9, 10])\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\nNote however, that because of this equivalence += for a list is not exactly the same as a + and = in all cases—for lists += allows arbitrary sequences (just like extend), but concatenation normally does not:\\n```\\n>>> L = []\\n>>> L += 'spam' # += and extend allow any sequence, but + does not!\\n>>> L\\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\\n>>> L = L + 'spam'\\nTypeError: can only concatenate list (not \\\"str\\\") to list\\n```\\n> Although Python now supports statements like X += Y, it still does not\\nhave C’s auto-increment/decrement operators (e.g., X++, −−X).\\n\\n### Naming\\nFor portability, case also matters in the names of imported module files, even on platforms where the filesystems are case-insensitive.\\n\\nTrue, False, and None, are somewhat unusual in meaning—they also appear in the built-in scope of Python described in Chapter 17, and they are technically names assigned to objects.\\n\\nNames that begin with a single underscore (_X) are not imported by a from module import * statement\\n\\nNames that begin with two underscores and do not end with two more (__X) are localized (“mangled”) to enclosing classes.\\n\\n### Expression Statements\\nIn Python, you can use an expression as a statement, too. Expressions are commonly used as statements in two situations:\\n- For calls to functions and methods\\n- For printing values at the interactive prompt\\n\\nA statement that is not an expression must generally appear on a line all by itself, not nested in a larger syntactic structure. For example, Python doesn’t allow you to embed assignment statements (=) in other expressions. Besides, C assignments return the value assigned, but Python assignments are just statements, not expressions.\\n\\nExpression statements are often used to run list methods that change a list in place:\\n```\\n>>> L = L.append(4) # But append returns None, not L\\n>>> print(L) # So we lose our list!\\nNone\\n```\\n\\nNormally, whether printed output is buffered in memory or not is determined by file; passing a true value to flush forcibly flushes the stream.\\n\\nBecause the print statement just sends text to the sys.stdout.write method, you can capture printed text in your programs by assigning sys.stdout to an object whose write method processes the text in arbitrary ways\\n\\n## if Tests and Syntax Rules\\nThere is no switch or case statement in Python\\n\\n* Block and statement boundaries are detected automatically.\\n* Compound statements = header + “:” + indented statements. \\n* Blank lines, spaces, and comments are usually ignored.\\n* Docstrings are ignored but are saved and displayed by tools.\\n\\nStatements may span multiple lines if you’re continuing an open syntactic\\npair.\\n\\nBoolean operators stop evaluating (“short circuit”) as soon as a result is known. Boolean **and** and **or** operators return a true or false object in Python, not the values True or False\\n\\nFor `A = Y if X else Z`, Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false.\\n\\nWhen defining classes, we can specify their Boolean nature with either the\\n__bool__ or __len__ methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n## while and for Loops\\nThe optional **else** block run if didn't exit loop with **break**\\n\\nPython doesn’t have what some languages call a “do until” loop statement. Python has no \\\"go to\\\" statement.\\n\\nPython 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as ... (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the pass statement,\\n```\\n>>> X = ... # Alternative to None\\n>>> X\\nEllipsis\\n```\\n\\nAfter the **for** loop, this loop variable normally still refers to the last item visited, which is the last item in the sequence unless the loop exits with a break statement.\\n\\nEven nested structures may be automatically unpacked this way in a for:\\n```\\n>>> for ((a, b), c) in [((1, 2), 3), ((4, 5), 6)]: print(a, b, c)\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, as a general rule, you should resist the temptation to count things in Python—its iteration tools automate much of the work you do to loop over collections in lower-level languages like C.\\n\\nbuilt-in tools: range, zip, enumerate\\n\\nThe zip function is more general than this example suggests. For instance,\\nit accepts any type of sequence (really, any iterable object, including files), and it accepts more than two arguments. Moreover, zip truncates result tuples at the length of the shortest sequence when the argument lengths differ.\\n\\n## Iterations and Comprehensions\\n* Iterator vs. Iterable vs. Iteration tool/context\\n* Single scan vs. multiple scan\\n\\nIn some cases these two objects are the same when only a single scan is supported (e.g., files), and the iterator object is often temporary, used internally by the iteration tool. Moreover, some objects are both an iteration context tool (they iterate) and an iterable object (their results are iterable)—including Chapter 20’s generator expressions, and map and zip in Python 3.X.\\n\\nWhen the for loop begins, it first obtains an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the iter built-in function; the object returned by iter in turn has the required next method. The iter function internally runs the __iter__ method, much like `next` and `__next__`.\\n\\nFor comprehensions, their full syntax allows for any number of **for** clauses, each of which can have an optional associated **if** clause.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that every built-in tool that scans from left to right across objects uses the iteration protocol.\\n\\nNotice that, unlike map and others, sorted returns an actual list in Python 3.X\\ninstead of an iterable.\\n\\nOne of the fundamental distinctions of Python 3.X is its stronger emphasis on iterators than 2.X. This, along with its Unicode model and mandated new-style classes, is one of 3.X’s most sweeping changes.\\n\\nUnlike **range**, **map**, **zip**, **filter** are their own iterators—after you step through their results once, they are exhausted.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X the dictionary keys, values, and items methods return iterable view objects that generate result items one at a time.\\n\\n## Documentation Interlude\\nThe PyDoc system covered here can render a module’s internal documentation as either plain text in a shell, or HTML in a web browser.\\n\\nThe **help** function: press the space bar to move to the next page, Enter to go to the next line, and Q to quit:\\n\\nSphinx\\n\\n# Functions and Generators\\n## Function Basics\\n* *def* is executable code. it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other *def*s.\\n* *def* creates an object and assigns it to a name. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined *attributes* attached to them to record data.\\n\\nNames are always looked up in *scopes*—places where variables are stored— and assignments bind names to scopes.\\n\\n>Files must generally be rewound (e.g., with a file.seek(0) or another\\nopen) after they have been read to end-of-file once, and so are single-pass iterators\\n\\n## Scopes\\nWhen we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term\\nscope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source\\ncode determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code.\\n\\nBy default, all names assigned inside a function are associated with that function’s namespace, and no other.\\n\\nLexical scoping:\\n- If a variable is assigned inside a def, it is local to that function.\\n- If a variable is assigned in an enclosing def, it is nonlocal to nested functions.\\n- If a variable is assigned outside all defs, it is global to the entire file.\\n\\nEach module is a global scope, the global scope spans a single file only.\\n* Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal\\n* All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins.\\n* Each call to a function creates a new local scope.\\n\\n> Note `L=X` within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not.\\n\\n### Name Resolution: The LEGB Rule\\n- Name assignments create or change local names by default.\\n- Name references search at most four scopes: local, then enclosing functions (if any), then global, then built-in.\\n- Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes, respectively.\\n\\nNote that the second scope lookup layer, E—the scopes of enclosing defs or lambdas—can technically correspond to more than one lookup level.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that these rules apply only to simple variable names (e.g., spam). Qualified attribute names (e.g., object.spam) live in particular objects and follow a completely different set of lookup rules than those covered here.\\n\\nThere are technically three more scopes in Python—temporary loop variables in some comprehensions, exception reference variables in some try handlers, and local scopes in class statements\\n\\nIn 3.X, the loop variables are local to the expression itself in all comprehension forms: generator, list, set, and dictionary. In 2.X, they are local to generator expressions and set and dictionary compressions, but not to list comprehensions that map their names to the scope outside the expression. By contrast, for loop statements never localize their variables to the statement block in any Python.\\n\\nIn 3.X, exception reference variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!).\\n\\nAlthough the LEGB rule is used to resolve\\nnames used in both the top level of a class itself as well as the top level of method functions nested within it, classes themselves are skipped by scope lookups—their names must be fetched as object attributes.\\n\\n### The global/nonlocal Statement\\nThe global statement consists of the keyword global, followed by one or more names separated by commas. All the listed names will be mapped to the enclosing module’s scope when assigned or referenced within the function body. \\n```\\nglobal x\\n```\\n\\nThe name x do not need even exist in the enclosing module\\nbefore the function runs; in this case, the first assignment in the function creates x in the module.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, X is declared nonlocal within the function in 3.X (only), the assignment changes the name X in the closest enclosing function’s local scope. The name X must have been defined in at least one enclosing function.\\n\\n```\\ndef f1():\\nx = 88\\ndef f2(x=x): # Remember enclosing scope X with defaults\\nprint(x)\\nf2()\\nf1() # Prints 88\\n```\\nBecause the second x is evaluated before Python steps into the nested def, it still refers to the x in f1.\\n```\\ndef func():\\nx = 4\\naction = (lambda n, x=x: x ** n) # Pass x in manually\\nreturn action\\n```\\nLoop variables may require defaults, not scopes, Compare\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Tries to remember each i\\nacts.append(lambda x: i ** x) # But all remember same last i!\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nwith\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Use defaults instead\\nacts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x) # Remember current i\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nBecause defaults are implemented as single objects attached to functions, mutable defaults retain state from call to call, rather than being initialized anew on each call.\\n\\nUnlike global, nonlocal names must already exist in the enclosing function’s scope when declared. In fact, they are checked at function definition time before either an enclosing or nested function is called.\\n\\nNonlocal both allows assignment to names in enclosing function scopes and limits scope lookups for such names to enclosing defs.\\n\\nPython uses naming conventions in both 2.X and 3.X that ensure that the arbitrary names you assign as function attributes won’t clash with names related to internal implementation.\\n\\nTo summarize: globals, nonlocals, classes, and function attributes all offer changeable state-retention options.\\n\\n## Arguments\\nIn Python 2.X, it’s also possible to automatically unpack tuples in arguments passed to a function.\\n```\\ndef f((a,(b,c)))\\n```\\nThis def syntax is no longer supported in Python 3.X. Instead, code this function as:\\n```\\ndef f(T): (a, (b, c)) = T\\n```\\nTuple unpacking argument syntax is also disallowed by 3.X in lambda\\nfunction argument lists. Somewhat asymmetrically, tuple unpacking assignment is still automatic in 3.X for loops targets\\n\\nBy default, arguments are matched by position, from left to right, and you must pass exactly as many arguments as there are argument names in the function header.\\n\\n![Table 18-1](../.pastes/2018-09-04-20-04-02.png)\\n\\nIn a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments or the *iterable form, followed by any keyword arguments or the **dict form. If we see *iterable and **dict as being unpacked to positional arguments and keyword arguments, the order becomes: any positional arguments, followed by any keyword arguments. In a broad sense, there are only two arguments: positional and keyword.\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g):\\n print('ok')\\nb=[2]\\nx = {'d':4,'e':5}\\ny = {'f':6}\\nfoo(1,*b,3,**x,g=7,**y) //ok\\n```\\n> In a function header, we use the term \\\"parameter\\\" instead of \\\"argument\\\"\\n\\nIn a function header, parameters must appear in this order: any normal parameter(name); followed by any default parameters (name=value); followed by the *name (or \\\\* in 3.X) form; followed by any name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form\\n\\nWe can use a * character by itself in the arguments list to indicate that a function does not accept a variable-length argument list but still expects all arguments following the * to be passed as keywords.\\n\\nThe *name=value* form has two meaning:\\n- before the form *name, it's positional with default value\\n- after the form *name, it's keyword-only with default value\\n\\nThere can be at most one *name parameter, which collects all remaining positional arguments (including those in *iterabe). Similarly, There can be at most one *\\\\*dict parameter, which collects all remaining keyword arguments (including those in *\\\\*dict arguments).\\n\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b=3,*c,d,**e):\\n print(b,e)\\nx = [3,4]\\ny = {'d':5,'e':6,'f':7}\\nfoo(1,2,*x,**y) # 2 {'e': 6, 'f': 7}\\n```\\nThe steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before\\nassignment can roughly be described as follows:\\n1. Assign nonkeyword arguments by position.\\n2. Assign keyword arguments by matching names.\\n3. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple.\\n4. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary.\\n5. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header.\\n\\n> Note that in both function call and header, the *name = value* form are not assignments.\\n\\nThe default parameters are attached to function objects, if you code\\na default to be a mutable object (e.g., def f(a=[])), the same, single\\nmutable object is reused every time the function is later called—even if\\nit is changed in place within the function.\\n\\nBelow is a tracer function example:\\n```\\ndef tracer(func, *pargs, **kargs): # Accept arbitrary arguments\\n print('calling:', func.__name__)\\n return func(*pargs, **kargs) # Pass along arbitrary arguments\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Function Topics\\nIn fact, recursion is not used nearly as often in Python as in\\nmore esoteric languages like Prolog or Lisp, because Python emphasizes simpler procedural statements like loops, which are usually more natural.\\n\\nOn the other hand, recursion—or equivalent explicit stack-based algorithms we’ll meet shortly—can be required to traverse arbitrarily shaped structures.\\n\\nAlso note that standard Python limits the depth of its runtime call stack—crucial to recursive call programs—to trap infinite recursion errors. To expand it, use the **sys** module:\\n```\\n>>> sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default\\n1000\\n>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting\\n>>> help(sys.setrecursionlimit) # Read more about it\\n```\\n\\n### Function attributes and annotations\\n```\\n>>> func.__code__\\n>>> func.__code__.co_varnames\\n```\\nPython’s own implementation-related data stored on functions follows naming conventions that prevent them from clashing with the more arbitrary attribute names you might assign yourself. In 3.X, all function internals’ names have leading and trailing double underscores (“_\\\\_X__”);\\n\\nAttributes are related to objects instead of scopes (and must be referenced through the function name within its code).\\n\\nPython provides special syntax for specifying annotations, but it doesn’t do anything with them itself; annotations are completely optional, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s __annotations__ attribute for use by other tools. Syntactically, function annotations are coded in def header lines, as arbitrary expressions associated with arguments and return values.\\n```\\n>>> def func(a: 'spam', b: (1, 10), c: float) -> int:\\nreturn a + b + c\\n>>> func(1, 2, 3)\\n6\\n>>> func.__annotations__\\n{'c': , 'b': (1, 10), 'a': 'spam', 'return': }\\n```\\n\\nFinally, note that annotations work only in def statements, not lambda expressions.\\n\\n- **lambda** is an expression, not a statement.\\n- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.\\n- Defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def.\\n- The code in a lambda body also follows the same scope lookup rules as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope (via the LEGB rule)\\n\\n```\\n>>> ((lambda x: (lambda y: x + y))(99))(4)\\n103\\n```\\n\\nuseful library: functools, operator\\n\\n## Comprehensions and Generations\\nmap calls can be twice as fast as equivalent for loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than map calls.\\n\\nGenerator function vs. Generator vs. Generator expression\\n- *send* advances to the next item \\n- *yield* is now an expression form, it must be enclose in parentheses unless it's the only item on the right ride of the assignment statement.\\n- methods: *throw*, *close*\\n- *yield from*\\n\\nGenerator expressions may also run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation.\\n\\nA subtle but important point: both generator functions and generator expressions are their own iterators and thus support just one active iteration.\\n\\nPython 3.X localizes loop variables in all four forms—temporary loop variable names in generator, set, dictionary, and list comprehensions are local to the expression.\\n\\nIn general, list comprehensions are usually the quickest of the bunch; map beats list comprehensions in Python only when all tools must call functions; for loops tend to be slower than comprehensions; and generator functions and expressions are slower than comprehensions by a constant factor. Under\\n\\n## The benchmarking Interlude\\nTimeing modules: time, timer, profile, timeit, pystone.py\\n\\n# Part V. Modules and Packages\\nModules are processed with two statements and one important function:\\n- import: Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole\\n- from: Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module\\n- imp.reload (reload in 2.X): Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python\\n\\nIn Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved until such import statements are executed at runtime; their net effect is to assign module names—simple variables like b—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module name used in an import statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external file to be loaded, but it also becomes a variable assigned to the loaded module.\\n\\nSimilarly, objects defined by a module are also created at runtime, as the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents.\\n\\nIn python, imports perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\\n1. Find the module’s file.\\n2. Compile it to byte code (if needed).\\n3. Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines.\\n\\nBear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named **sys.mod** ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins. (see **imp.reload**)\\n> Python keeps already imported modules in the built-in **sys.modules** dictionary so it can keep track of what’s been loaded.\\n\\nNotice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your machine.\\n\\n### The Module Search Path\\nRoughly, Python’s module search path is composed of the concatenation of these major components, some of which are preset for you and some of which you can tailor to tell Python where to look:\\n1. The home directory of the program (subdirectories not included)\\n2. PYTHONPATH directories (if set)\\n3. Standard library directories\\n4. The contents of any .pth files (if present)\\n5. The site-packages home of third-party extensions\\n\\nUltimately, the concatenation of these four components becomes **sys.path**, a mutable list of directory. The first and\\nthird elements of the search path are defined automatically. Because Python searches the concatenation of these components from first to last, though, the second and fourth elements can be used to extend the path to include your own source code directories.\\n\\nBy modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a program’s run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path—the first per user, and the second per installation.\\n\\nPython automatically selects any type that matches a module’s name. For same names with different extensions, Python follows a standard picking order, though this order is not guaranteed to stay the same over time or across implementations. \\n\\nBy using import hooks, archived files are automatically extracted at import time when a .zip file is selected from the module import search path.\\n\\nFor details, see the builtin **importlib._\\\\_import__** function\\n\\nThird-party extensions for Python typically use the **distutils** tools in the standard library to automatically install themselves, so no path configuration is required to use their code.\\n\\nSystems that use distutils generally come with a setup.py script, which is run to install them; this script imports and uses distutils modules to place such systems in a directory that is automatically part of the module search path (usually in the Lib\\\\site-packages subdirectory of the Python install tree, wherever that resides on the target machine).\\n\\n## Module Coding Basics\\n### Module Filenames\\nThe .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported.\\n\\nIn fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in\\npackage imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented.\\n\\n**import** fetches the module as a whole, so you\\nmust qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, **from** fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, the from ...* statement form described here can be used\\nonly at the top level of a module file, not within a function.\\n\\nJust like def, import and from are executable statements, not compile-time declarations. They may be nested in if tests, to select among options; appear in function defs, to be loaded only on calls (subject to the preceding note); be used in try statements, to provide defaults; and so on.\\n```\\n>>> from small import x, y # Copy two names out\\n>>> x = 42 # Changes local x only\\n>>> y[0] = 42 # Changes shared mutable in place\\n```\\n\\nAt least conceptually, a from statement like this one:\\n```\\nfrom module import name1, name2 # Copy these two names out (only)\\n```\\nis equivalent to this statement sequence:\\n\\n```\\nimport module # Fetch the module object\\nname1 = module.name1 # Copy names out by assignment\\nname2 = module.name2\\ndel module # Get rid of the module name\\n```\\n\\nThe **from** always imports the entire module into memory if it has not yet been imported, regardless of how many names it copies out of the file. There is no way to load just part of a module file.\\n\\nMoreover, the from module import * form really can corrupt namespaces and make names difficult to understand, especially when applied to more than one file.\\n\\nProbably the best real-world advice here is to generally prefer import to from for simple modules, to explicitly list the variables you want in most from statements, and to limit the from * form to just one import per file.\\n\\nThe **as** extension works in both import and from as a simple renaming tool.\\n\\nIn fact, internally, module namespaces are stored as dictionary objects.\\n\\nThe LEGB scope rule applies only to bare, unqualified names—it may be used for the leftmost name in a name path, but later names after dots search specific objects instead.\\n\\nlexical scoping notion—in Python, the scopes surrounding\\na piece of code are completely determined by the code’s physical position in your file. Scopes are never influenced by function calls or module imports.\\n\\nimport operations never give upward visibility to code in imported files\\n—an imported file cannot see names in the importing file. In some sense, although imports do not nest namespaces upward, they do nest downward.\\n```\\nprint(mod2.mod3.X) # Nested mod3's X\\n```\\n\\n### Reloading Modules\\nThe **reload** function forces an already loaded module’s code to be reloaded and rerun. Assignments in the file’s new code change the existing module object in place.\\n\\n> Note that reload currently only works on modules\\nwritten in Python;\\n\\nBecause reload expects an object, a module must have been previously imported successfully before you can reload it.\\n\\nWhen you call reload, Python rereads the module file’s source code and reruns its toplevel statements. Perhaps the most important thing to know about reload is that it changes a module object in place; it does not delete and re-create the module object.\\n- Reloads impact all clients that use **import** to fetch modules\\n- Reloads impact future from clients only. Clients that used from to fetch attributes in the past won’t be affected by a reload; they’ll still have references to the old objects fetched before the reload.\\n- Reloads apply to a single module only. You must run them on each module you wish to update, unless you use code or tools that apply reloads transitively.\\n\\n## Module Packages\\nDotted package \\n**from package import item**: the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable.\\n**import item.subitem.subitem**: each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can't be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.\\n\\nTow kinds of imports:\\n- absolute imports\\n- relative imports\\n\\nIn sum, Python imports select between relative (in the containing directory) and absolute (in a directory on sys.path) resolutions as follows:\\n- Dotted imports: from . import m \\nAre relative-only in both 2.X and 3.X\\n- Nondotted imports: import m, from m import x \\nAre relative-then-absolute in 2.X, and absolute-only in 3.X\\n\\nNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always \\\"__main__\\\", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.\\n\\nPython 3.3 adds another flavor to modules: *namespace packages*.\\n\\nPackages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package.\\n\\nTwo kinds of packages:\\n* regular packages\\n* namespace

Notes for Learning Python 5th\\n---\\n[[toc]]\\n# Types and Operations\\nObjects are pieces of memory, with values and sets of associated operations. Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of obj \\n\\nThe Python Conceptual Hierarchy:\\n1. Programs are composed of modules.\\n2. Modules contain statements.\\n3. Statements contain expressions.\\n4. Expressions create and process objects.\\n\\n![Table 4-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-05-36.png)\\nIn formal terms, this means that Python is dynamically typed , a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also strongly typed, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type.\\n\\n## Core Types\\nImmutable: number, string, tuple, bytes \\nMutable: list, dictionary, set, bytearray\\n\\nPrimitive: number \\nCollection:\\n* Sequence: string, tuple, bytes, list, bytearray\\n* Mapping: dictionary, set\\n\\nbytearray is a distinct hybrid of immutable bytes strings (whose b'...' syntax is required in 3.X and optional in 2.X) and mutable lists (coded and displayed in [] ).\\n\\ngeneric operations that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g. `len(X)` , `X[0]` ), but type-specific operations are method calls (e.g., `aString.upper()` ).\\n\\nBoth `dir` and `help` also accept as arguments either a real object (like our string S) , or the name of a data type (like str , list , and dict ).\\n\\nAs a notable difference, Python 2.X allows its normal and Unicode strings to be mixed in expressions as long as the normal string is all ASCII; in contrast, Python 3.X has a tighter model that never allows its normal and byte strings to mix without explicit conversion.\\n\\nNone of the string object’s own methods support pattern-based text processing.\\n\\nUnlike out-of-bounds assignments in lists, which are forbidden, assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys, fetching a nonexistent key is still a mistake. (Use the get() method)\\n\\nA file’s contents are always a string in your script, regardless of\\nthe type of data the file contains:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> for line in open('data.txt'): print(line)\\n```\\n\\t\\nText files represent content as normal str strings and perform\\nUnicode encoding and decoding automatically when writing and reading data, while binary files represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered.\\n\\nSets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects.\\nDecimal, Fraction, booleans\\n\\nAs you’ll learn, in Python, we code to object interfaces (operations supported), not to types.\\n\\n## Numbers\\n![Table 5-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-09-34.png)\\n\\nFloating-point numbers are implemented as C “doubles” in standard CPython, and therefore get as much precision as the C compiler used to build the Python interpreter gives to doubles.\\n\\nbuilt-in calls: hex(I), oct(I), bin(I), int(str,base), X.bit_length(),round(X), X.as_integer_ratio()\\n\\nInternally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers\\n\\n![Table 5-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-10-38.png)\\n\\nComparison operators may be chained: X < Y < Z produces the same result as X < Y and Y < Z .\\n```python\\n>>> 1 == 2 < 3 # Same as: 1 == 2 and 2 < 3\\nFalse # Not same as: False < 3 (which means 0 < 3, which is true!)\\n```\\n\\t\\nIn recent Pythons, the slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)].\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons are not allowed and raise exceptions; this includes sorts by proxy.\\n\\n* Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so bind more tightly in mixed expressions.\\n* Operators in the same row in Table 5-2 generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right).\\n\\nBesides mixing operators in expressions, you can also mix numeric types: \\nin mixed-type numeric expressions, Python first converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand, and then performs the math on same-type operands. Python ranks the complexity of numeric types like so: integers are simpler than floating point numbers, which are simpler than complex numbers. \\nIn general, Python does not convert across any other type boundaries automatically. Adding a string to an integer, for example, results in an error, unless you manually convert one or the other.\\n\\n In 3.X, the / now always performs true division, returning a float result that includes any remainder, regardless of operand types. The // performs floor division, which truncates the remainder and returns an integer for integer operands or a float if any operand is a float.\\n\\nThe // operator truncates the result down to its floor, which means the closest whole number below the true result.\\n\\nFrozenset\\n\\nInternally, the names True and False are instances of bool , which is in turn just a subclass (in the object oriented sense) of the built-in integer type int . True and False behave exactly like the integers 1 and 0, except that they have customized printing logic.\\n```\\n>>> True + 4 # (Hmmm)\\n5\\n```\\n\\t\\nNumpy, Scipy\\n\\t\\nThe dynamic typing\\nA variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.\\n\\nVariables always link to objects and never to other variables, but larger objects may link to other objects (for instance, a list object has links to the objects it contains).\\nThese links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory\\n\\nTechnically speaking, objects have more structure than just enough space to represent their values. Each object also has two standard header fields: a type designator used to mark the type of the object, and a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object.\\n\\nreference counter, cyclic reference\\n\\tsys.getrefcount(X)\\n\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in expression, they are copied. e.g. after b=a[:3], b refers to a new object.\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in left side of assignment, they referred to the original object. e.g. after a=[0,1,2] a[:] = [0,1], a becomes [0,1]\\n\\n Because everything seems to work by assignment and references\\nin Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. As you’ll see, it works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python;\\n\\nweakref\\n\\n## String\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-12-13-34.png)\\n\\n![Table 7-1]($resource/2018-09-03-16-34-23.png)\\nString literal forms:\\n* Single quotes: 'spa\\\"m'\\n* Double quotes: \\\"spa'm\\\"\\n* Triple quotes: '''... spam ...''' , \\\"\\\"\\\"... spam ...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n* Escape sequences: \\\"s\\\\tp\\\\na\\\\0m\\\"\\n* Raw strings: r\\\"C:\\\\new\\\\test.spm\\\"\\n* Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): b'sp\\\\x01am'\\n* Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): u'eggs\\\\u0020spam'\\n\\nIn fact, 3.X defines str strings formally as sequences of Unicode code\\npoints, not bytes, to make this clear.

Because it can be a bit complex, it is perhaps best thought of as a combination of two steps:\\n1. Deletion. The slice you specify to the left of the = is deleted.\\n2. Insertion. The new items contained in the iterable object to the right of the = are inserted into the list on the left, at the place where the old slice was deleted.\\nNote, L[2:5]=L[3:6], for instance, works fine because the value to be inserted is fetched before the deletion\\nhappens on the left.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1]\\n>>> L[:0] = [2, 3, 4] # Insert all at :0, an empty slice at front\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1]\\n>>> L[len(L):] = [5, 6, 7] # Insert all at len(L):, an empty slice at end\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]\\n>>> L.extend([8, 9, 10]) # Insert all at end, named method\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\n\\t\\nThe effect of `L.append(X)` is similar to `L+[X]`, but while the former changes L in place, the latter makes a new list.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, this has changed: magnitude comparison of mixed types\\nraises an exception instead of falling back on the fixed cross-type ordering.\\n\\nL.sort() vs. sorted\\nbuilt-in tools: reversed\\n\\nLike lists, dictionaries store object references (not copies, unless you ask for them explicitly)\\n\\n![Table 8-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-20.png)\\n\\nkeys in 3.X returns an iterable object, instead of a physical list\\nUnlike lists, however, whenever you assign a new dictionary key (one that hasn’t been assigned before) you create a new entry in the dictionary.\\n\\nIn 3.X the dictionary keys , values , and items methods all return view objects , whereas in 2.X they return actual result lists. \\nBesides being iterable, dictionary views also retain the original order of dictionary components, reflect future changes to the dictionary, and may support set operations. Unlike 2.X’s list results, though, dictionary views in 3.X are not carved in stone when created—they dynamically reflect future changes made to the dictionary after the view object has been created:\\n\\n In set operations, views may be mixed with other views, sets, and dictionaries; dictionaries\\nare treated the same as their keys views in this context:\\n```\\n>>> D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\\n>>> D.keys() & D.keys() # Intersect keys views\\n{'b', 'c', 'a'}\\n>>> D.keys() & {'b'} # Intersect keys and set\\n{'b'}\\n>>> D.\\n```\\n\\n```\\n>>> Ks.sort()\\nAttributeError: 'dict_keys' object has no attribute 'sort'\\n```\\nTo work around this, in 3.X you must either convert to a list manually or use the\\nsorted call (introduced in Chapter 4 and covered in this chapter) on either a keys view\\nor the dictionary itself:\\n\\nOrderedDict\\n\\n## Tuples, files and everything else\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-16-36-56.png)\\n![Table 9-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-57.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, named tuples are a tuple/class/dictionary hybrid\\n (In short, named tuples build new classes that extend the tuple type, inserting a property accessor method for each named field that maps the name to its position)\\n \\n![Table 9-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-03-26.png)\\n\\nEmpty lines in the file come back as strings containing just a newline character, not as empty strings.\\n```\\n>>> myfile.readline() # Empty string: end-of-file\\n''\\n```\\n\\t\\n* Text files represent content as normal str strings, perform Unicode encoding and decoding automatically, and perform end-of-line translation by default.\\n* Binary files represent content as a special bytes string type and allow programs to access file content unaltered.\\n\\npickle, shelve, json, struct\\n\\n In fact, when nested objects are present, Python automatically\\ntraverses data structures to apply comparisons from left to right, and as deeply as\\nneeded.\\n\\n More specifically, Python compares types as follows:\\n- Numbers are compared by relative magnitude, after conversion to the common highest type if needed.\\n- Strings are compared lexicographically (by the character set code point values returned by `ord` ), and character by character until the end or first mismatch (\\\"abc\\\"< \\\"ac\\\" ).\\n- Lists and tuples are compared by comparing each component from left to right, and recursively for nested structures, until the end or first mismatch ([2] > [1, 2] ).\\n- Sets are equal if both contain the same items (formally, if each is a subset of the other), and set relative magnitude comparisons apply subset and superset tests.\\n- Dictionaries compare as equal if their sorted (key, value) lists are equal. Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X, but they work in 2.X as though comparing sorted (key, value) lists.\\n- Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 < 'spam' ) are errors in Python 3.X. They are allowed in Python 2.X, but use a fixed but arbitrary ordering rule based on type name string. By proxy, this also applies to sorts, which use comparisons internally: nonnumeric mixed-type collections cannot be sorted in 3.X.\\n\\nPython 3.X disallows mixed-type magnitude testing, except numeric types.\\n\\nMore generally, the notions of true and false are intrinsic properties of every object in Python—each object is either true or false, as follows:\\n- Numbers are false if zero, and true otherwise.\\n- Other objects are false if empty, and true otherwise.\\n\\n That is, *None* is something, not nothing (despite its name!)—it is a real object and a real piece of memory that is created and given a built-in name by Python itself.\\n\\n In fact, even types themselves are an object type in Python.\\n Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage.\\n\\nFor classic classes in Python 2.X, all class instances are instead of the type “instance,” and we must compare instance `__class__` attributes to compare their types meaningfully.\\n\\nRepetition Adds One Level Deep\\n```python\\n>>> L = [4, 5, 6]\\n>>> X = L * 4 # Like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...\\n>>> Y = [L] * 4 # [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...]\\n```\\n\\t\\nIf you remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much more sense\\n\\nBeware of Cyclic Data Structure\\n```python\\n>>> L = ['grail'] # Append reference to same object\\n>>> L.append(L) # Generates cycle in object: [...]\\n>>> L\\n['grail', [...]]\\n```\\n\\n# Statements and Syntax\\n## Assignments, Expressions, and Prints\\n- Assignments create object references. (i.e. link a name with an object) They always create references to objects instead of copying the objects.\\n- Names are created when first assigned.\\n- Names must be assigned before referenced.\\n\\nModule imports, function and class definitions, for loop variables, and function arguments are all implicit assignments.\\n\\n![Table 11-1]($resource/2018-09-03-13-40-51.png)\\n\\nsequence assignment—any sequence of names can be\\nassigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items one at a time by position. In fact, the original tuple and list assignment forms in Python have been generalized to accept any type of sequence (really, iterable) on the right as long as it is of the same length as the sequence on the left.\\n\\nMultiple-target assignment: Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object farthest to the right) to all the targets on the left.\\n\\nIn tuple/list assignment, Python creates a temporary tuple that saves the original values of the variables on the right before assigning.\\n\\nwe can even assign nested sequences, and Python unpacks their parts according to their shape, as expected. The sequence-nesting shape of the object on the left must match that of the object on the right.\\n> This nested tuple (really, sequence) unpacking\\nassignment form works for function argument lists in Python 2.X (though not in 3.X)\\n\\nIn short, a single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target in order to specify a more general matching against the sequence—the starred name is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names. In fact, the starred name can appear anywhere in the target.\\n> This is similar in spirit to slicing, but not exactly the same—a sequence unpacking assignment always returns a list for multiple matched items, whereas slicing returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced\\n```\\n>>> a, *b = 'spam'\\n>>> a, b\\n('s', ['p', 'a', 'm'])\\n>>> S[0], S[1:] # Slices are type-specific, * assignment always returns a list\\n('s', 'pam')\\n```\\n\\nFinally, errors can still be triggered if there is more than one starred name, if there are too few values and no star (as before), and if the starred name is not itself coded inside a sequence:\\n```\\n>>> *a = seq\\nSyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple\\n```\\n\\nFor augmented assignments, inplace operations may be applied for mutable objects as an optimization.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1, 2]\\n>>> L = L + [3] # Concatenate: slower\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> L.append(4) # Faster, but in place\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\n>>> L += [9, 10] # Mapped to L.extend([9, 10])\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\nNote however, that because of this equivalence += for a list is not exactly the same as a + and = in all cases—for lists += allows arbitrary sequences (just like extend), but concatenation normally does not:\\n```\\n>>> L = []\\n>>> L += 'spam' # += and extend allow any sequence, but + does not!\\n>>> L\\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\\n>>> L = L + 'spam'\\nTypeError: can only concatenate list (not \\\"str\\\") to list\\n```\\n> Although Python now supports statements like X += Y, it still does not\\nhave C’s auto-increment/decrement operators (e.g., X++, −−X).\\n\\n### Naming\\nFor portability, case also matters in the names of imported module files, even on platforms where the filesystems are case-insensitive.\\n\\nTrue, False, and None, are somewhat unusual in meaning—they also appear in the built-in scope of Python described in Chapter 17, and they are technically names assigned to objects.\\n\\nNames that begin with a single underscore (_X) are not imported by a from module import * statement\\n\\nNames that begin with two underscores and do not end with two more (__X) are localized (“mangled”) to enclosing classes.\\n\\n### Expression Statements\\nIn Python, you can use an expression as a statement, too. Expressions are commonly used as statements in two situations:\\n- For calls to functions and methods\\n- For printing values at the interactive prompt\\n\\nA statement that is not an expression must generally appear on a line all by itself, not nested in a larger syntactic structure. For example, Python doesn’t allow you to embed assignment statements (=) in other expressions. Besides, C assignments return the value assigned, but Python assignments are just statements, not expressions.\\n\\nExpression statements are often used to run list methods that change a list in place:\\n```\\n>>> L = L.append(4) # But append returns None, not L\\n>>> print(L) # So we lose our list!\\nNone\\n```\\n\\nNormally, whether printed output is buffered in memory or not is determined by file; passing a true value to flush forcibly flushes the stream.\\n\\nBecause the print statement just sends text to the sys.stdout.write method, you can capture printed text in your programs by assigning sys.stdout to an object whose write method processes the text in arbitrary ways\\n\\n## if Tests and Syntax Rules\\nThere is no switch or case statement in Python\\n\\n* Block and statement boundaries are detected automatically.\\n* Compound statements = header + “:” + indented statements. \\n* Blank lines, spaces, and comments are usually ignored.\\n* Docstrings are ignored but are saved and displayed by tools.\\n\\nStatements may span multiple lines if you’re continuing an open syntactic\\npair.\\n\\nBoolean operators stop evaluating (“short circuit”) as soon as a result is known. Boolean **and** and **or** operators return a true or false object in Python, not the values True or False\\n\\nFor `A = Y if X else Z`, Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false.\\n\\nWhen defining classes, we can specify their Boolean nature with either the\\n__bool__ or __len__ methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n## while and for Loops\\nThe optional **else** block run if didn't exit loop with **break**\\n\\nPython doesn’t have what some languages call a “do until” loop statement. Python has no \\\"go to\\\" statement.\\n\\nPython 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as ... (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the pass statement,\\n```\\n>>> X = ... # Alternative to None\\n>>> X\\nEllipsis\\n```\\n\\nAfter the **for** loop, this loop variable normally still refers to the last item visited, which is the last item in the sequence unless the loop exits with a break statement.\\n\\nEven nested structures may be automatically unpacked this way in a for:\\n```\\n>>> for ((a, b), c) in [((1, 2), 3), ((4, 5), 6)]: print(a, b, c)\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, as a general rule, you should resist the temptation to count things in Python—its iteration tools automate much of the work you do to loop over collections in lower-level languages like C.\\n\\nbuilt-in tools: range, zip, enumerate\\n\\nThe zip function is more general than this example suggests. For instance,\\nit accepts any type of sequence (really, any iterable object, including files), and it accepts more than two arguments. Moreover, zip truncates result tuples at the length of the shortest sequence when the argument lengths differ.\\n\\n## Iterations and Comprehensions\\n* Iterator vs. Iterable vs. Iteration tool/context\\n* Single scan vs. multiple scan\\n\\nIn some cases these two objects are the same when only a single scan is supported (e.g., files), and the iterator object is often temporary, used internally by the iteration tool. Moreover, some objects are both an iteration context tool (they iterate) and an iterable object (their results are iterable)—including Chapter 20’s generator expressions, and map and zip in Python 3.X.\\n\\nWhen the for loop begins, it first obtains an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the iter built-in function; the object returned by iter in turn has the required next method. The iter function internally runs the __iter__ method, much like `next` and `__next__`.\\n\\nFor comprehensions, their full syntax allows for any number of **for** clauses, each of which can have an optional associated **if** clause.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that every built-in tool that scans from left to right across objects uses the iteration protocol.\\n\\nNotice that, unlike map and others, sorted returns an actual list in Python 3.X\\ninstead of an iterable.\\n\\nOne of the fundamental distinctions of Python 3.X is its stronger emphasis on iterators than 2.X. This, along with its Unicode model and mandated new-style classes, is one of 3.X’s most sweeping changes.\\n\\nUnlike **range**, **map**, **zip**, **filter** are their own iterators—after you step through their results once, they are exhausted.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X the dictionary keys, values, and items methods return iterable view objects that generate result items one at a time.\\n\\n## Documentation Interlude\\nThe PyDoc system covered here can render a module’s internal documentation as either plain text in a shell, or HTML in a web browser.\\n\\nThe **help** function: press the space bar to move to the next page, Enter to go to the next line, and Q to quit:\\n\\nSphinx\\n\\n# Functions and Generators\\n## Function Basics\\n* *def* is executable code. it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other *def*s.\\n* *def* creates an object and assigns it to a name. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined *attributes* attached to them to record data.\\n\\nNames are always looked up in *scopes*—places where variables are stored— and assignments bind names to scopes.\\n\\n>Files must generally be rewound (e.g., with a file.seek(0) or another\\nopen) after they have been read to end-of-file once, and so are single-pass iterators\\n\\n## Scopes\\nWhen we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term\\nscope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source\\ncode determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code.\\n\\nBy default, all names assigned inside a function are associated with that function’s namespace, and no other.\\n\\nLexical scoping:\\n- If a variable is assigned inside a def, it is local to that function.\\n- If a variable is assigned in an enclosing def, it is nonlocal to nested functions.\\n- If a variable is assigned outside all defs, it is global to the entire file.\\n\\nEach module is a global scope, the global scope spans a single file only.\\n* Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal\\n* All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins.\\n* Each call to a function creates a new local scope.\\n\\n> Note `L=X` within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not.\\n\\n### Name Resolution: The LEGB Rule\\n- Name assignments create or change local names by default.\\n- Name references search at most four scopes: local, then enclosing functions (if any), then global, then built-in.\\n- Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes, respectively.\\n\\nNote that the second scope lookup layer, E—the scopes of enclosing defs or lambdas—can technically correspond to more than one lookup level.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that these rules apply only to simple variable names (e.g., spam). Qualified attribute names (e.g., object.spam) live in particular objects and follow a completely different set of lookup rules than those covered here.\\n\\nThere are technically three more scopes in Python—temporary loop variables in some comprehensions, exception reference variables in some try handlers, and local scopes in class statements\\n\\nIn 3.X, the loop variables are local to the expression itself in all comprehension forms: generator, list, set, and dictionary. In 2.X, they are local to generator expressions and set and dictionary compressions, but not to list comprehensions that map their names to the scope outside the expression. By contrast, for loop statements never localize their variables to the statement block in any Python.\\n\\nIn 3.X, exception reference variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!).\\n\\nAlthough the LEGB rule is used to resolve\\nnames used in both the top level of a class itself as well as the top level of method functions nested within it, classes themselves are skipped by scope lookups—their names must be fetched as object attributes.\\n\\n### The global/nonlocal Statement\\nThe global statement consists of the keyword global, followed by one or more names separated by commas. All the listed names will be mapped to the enclosing module’s scope when assigned or referenced within the function body. \\n```\\nglobal x\\n```\\n\\nThe name x do not need even exist in the enclosing module\\nbefore the function runs; in this case, the first assignment in the function creates x in the module.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, X is declared nonlocal within the function in 3.X (only), the assignment changes the name X in the closest enclosing function’s local scope. The name X must have been defined in at least one enclosing function.\\n\\n```\\ndef f1():\\nx = 88\\ndef f2(x=x): # Remember enclosing scope X with defaults\\nprint(x)\\nf2()\\nf1() # Prints 88\\n```\\nBecause the second x is evaluated before Python steps into the nested def, it still refers to the x in f1.\\n```\\ndef func():\\nx = 4\\naction = (lambda n, x=x: x ** n) # Pass x in manually\\nreturn action\\n```\\nLoop variables may require defaults, not scopes, Compare\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Tries to remember each i\\nacts.append(lambda x: i ** x) # But all remember same last i!\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nwith\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Use defaults instead\\nacts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x) # Remember current i\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nBecause defaults are implemented as single objects attached to functions, mutable defaults retain state from call to call, rather than being initialized anew on each call.\\n\\nUnlike global, nonlocal names must already exist in the enclosing function’s scope when declared. In fact, they are checked at function definition time before either an enclosing or nested function is called.\\n\\nNonlocal both allows assignment to names in enclosing function scopes and limits scope lookups for such names to enclosing defs.\\n\\nPython uses naming conventions in both 2.X and 3.X that ensure that the arbitrary names you assign as function attributes won’t clash with names related to internal implementation.\\n\\nTo summarize: globals, nonlocals, classes, and function attributes all offer changeable state-retention options.\\n\\n## Arguments\\nIn Python 2.X, it’s also possible to automatically unpack tuples in arguments passed to a function.\\n```\\ndef f((a,(b,c)))\\n```\\nThis def syntax is no longer supported in Python 3.X. Instead, code this function as:\\n```\\ndef f(T): (a, (b, c)) = T\\n```\\nTuple unpacking argument syntax is also disallowed by 3.X in lambda\\nfunction argument lists. Somewhat asymmetrically, tuple unpacking assignment is still automatic in 3.X for loops targets\\n\\nBy default, arguments are matched by position, from left to right, and you must pass exactly as many arguments as there are argument names in the function header.\\n\\n![Table 18-1]($resource/2018-09-04-20-04-02.png)\\n\\nIn a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments or the *iterable form, followed by any keyword arguments or the **dict form. If we see *iterable and **dict as being unpacked to positional arguments and keyword arguments, the order becomes: any positional arguments, followed by any keyword arguments. In a broad sense, there are only two arguments: positional and keyword.\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g):\\n print('ok')\\nb=[2]\\nx = {'d':4,'e':5}\\ny = {'f':6}\\nfoo(1,*b,3,**x,g=7,**y) //ok\\n```\\n> In a function header, we use the term \\\"parameter\\\" instead of \\\"argument\\\"\\n\\nIn a function header, parameters must appear in this order: any normal parameter(name); followed by any default parameters (name=value); followed by the *name (or \\\\* in 3.X) form; followed by any name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form\\n\\nWe can use a * character by itself in the arguments list to indicate that a function does not accept a variable-length argument list but still expects all arguments following the * to be passed as keywords.\\n\\nThe *name=value* form has two meaning:\\n- before the form *name, it's positional with default value\\n- after the form *name, it's keyword-only with default value\\n\\nThere can be at most one *name parameter, which collects all remaining positional arguments (including those in *iterabe). Similarly, There can be at most one *\\\\*dict parameter, which collects all remaining keyword arguments (including those in *\\\\*dict arguments).\\n\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b=3,*c,d,**e):\\n print(b,e)\\nx = [3,4]\\ny = {'d':5,'e':6,'f':7}\\nfoo(1,2,*x,**y) # 2 {'e': 6, 'f': 7}\\n```\\nThe steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before\\nassignment can roughly be described as follows:\\n1. Assign nonkeyword arguments by position.\\n2. Assign keyword arguments by matching names.\\n3. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple.\\n4. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary.\\n5. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header.\\n\\n> Note that in both function call and header, the *name = value* form are not assignments.\\n\\nThe default parameters are attached to function objects, if you code\\na default to be a mutable object (e.g., def f(a=[])), the same, single\\nmutable object is reused every time the function is later called—even if\\nit is changed in place within the function.\\n\\nBelow is a tracer function example:\\n```\\ndef tracer(func, *pargs, **kargs): # Accept arbitrary arguments\\n print('calling:', func.__name__)\\n return func(*pargs, **kargs) # Pass along arbitrary arguments\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Function Topics\\nIn fact, recursion is not used nearly as often in Python as in\\nmore esoteric languages like Prolog or Lisp, because Python emphasizes simpler procedural statements like loops, which are usually more natural.\\n\\nOn the other hand, recursion—or equivalent explicit stack-based algorithms we’ll meet shortly—can be required to traverse arbitrarily shaped structures.\\n\\nAlso note that standard Python limits the depth of its runtime call stack—crucial to recursive call programs—to trap infinite recursion errors. To expand it, use the **sys** module:\\n```\\n>>> sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default\\n1000\\n>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting\\n>>> help(sys.setrecursionlimit) # Read more about it\\n```\\n\\n### Function attributes and annotations\\n```\\n>>> func.__code__\\n>>> func.__code__.co_varnames\\n```\\nPython’s own implementation-related data stored on functions follows naming conventions that prevent them from clashing with the more arbitrary attribute names you might assign yourself. In 3.X, all function internals’ names have leading and trailing double underscores (“_\\\\_X__”);\\n\\nAttributes are related to objects instead of scopes (and must be referenced through the function name within its code).\\n\\nPython provides special syntax for specifying annotations, but it doesn’t do anything with them itself; annotations are completely optional, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s __annotations__ attribute for use by other tools. Syntactically, function annotations are coded in def header lines, as arbitrary expressions associated with arguments and return values.\\n```\\n>>> def func(a: 'spam', b: (1, 10), c: float) -> int:\\nreturn a + b + c\\n>>> func(1, 2, 3)\\n6\\n>>> func.__annotations__\\n{'c': , 'b': (1, 10), 'a': 'spam', 'return': }\\n```\\n\\nFinally, note that annotations work only in def statements, not lambda expressions.\\n\\n- **lambda** is an expression, not a statement.\\n- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.\\n- Defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def.\\n- The code in a lambda body also follows the same scope lookup rules as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope (via the LEGB rule)\\n\\n```\\n>>> ((lambda x: (lambda y: x + y))(99))(4)\\n103\\n```\\n\\nuseful library: functools, operator\\n\\n## Comprehensions and Generations\\nmap calls can be twice as fast as equivalent for loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than map calls.\\n\\nGenerator function vs. Generator vs. Generator expression\\n- *send* advances to the next item \\n- *yield* is now an expression form, it must be enclose in parentheses unless it's the only item on the right ride of the assignment statement.\\n- methods: *throw*, *close*\\n- *yield from*\\n\\nGenerator expressions may also run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation.\\n\\nA subtle but important point: both generator functions and generator expressions are their own iterators and thus support just one active iteration.\\n\\nPython 3.X localizes loop variables in all four forms—temporary loop variable names in generator, set, dictionary, and list comprehensions are local to the expression.\\n\\nIn general, list comprehensions are usually the quickest of the bunch; map beats list comprehensions in Python only when all tools must call functions; for loops tend to be slower than comprehensions; and generator functions and expressions are slower than comprehensions by a constant factor. Under\\n\\n## The benchmarking Interlude\\nTimeing modules: time, timer, profile, timeit, pystone.py\\n\\n# Part V. Modules and Packages\\nModules are processed with two statements and one important function:\\n- import: Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole\\n- from: Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module\\n- imp.reload (reload in 2.X): Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python\\n\\nIn Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved until such import statements are executed at runtime; their net effect is to assign module names—simple variables like b—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module name used in an import statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external file to be loaded, but it also becomes a variable assigned to the loaded module.\\n\\nSimilarly, objects defined by a module are also created at runtime, as the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents.\\n\\nIn python, imports perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\\n1. Find the module’s file.\\n2. Compile it to byte code (if needed).\\n3. Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines.\\n\\nBear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named **sys.mod** ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins. (see **imp.reload**)\\n> Python keeps already imported modules in the built-in **sys.modules** dictionary so it can keep track of what’s been loaded.\\n\\nNotice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your machine.\\n\\n### The Module Search Path\\nRoughly, Python’s module search path is composed of the concatenation of these major components, some of which are preset for you and some of which you can tailor to tell Python where to look:\\n1. The home directory of the program (subdirectories not included)\\n2. PYTHONPATH directories (if set)\\n3. Standard library directories\\n4. The contents of any .pth files (if present)\\n5. The site-packages home of third-party extensions\\n\\nUltimately, the concatenation of these four components becomes **sys.path**, a mutable list of directory. The first and\\nthird elements of the search path are defined automatically. Because Python searches the concatenation of these components from first to last, though, the second and fourth elements can be used to extend the path to include your own source code directories.\\n\\nBy modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a program’s run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path—the first per user, and the second per installation.\\n\\nPython automatically selects any type that matches a module’s name. For same names with different extensions, Python follows a standard picking order, though this order is not guaranteed to stay the same over time or across implementations. \\n\\nBy using import hooks, archived files are automatically extracted at import time when a .zip file is selected from the module import search path.\\n\\nFor details, see the builtin **importlib._\\\\_import__** function\\n\\nThird-party extensions for Python typically use the **distutils** tools in the standard library to automatically install themselves, so no path configuration is required to use their code.\\n\\nSystems that use distutils generally come with a setup.py script, which is run to install them; this script imports and uses distutils modules to place such systems in a directory that is automatically part of the module search path (usually in the Lib\\\\site-packages subdirectory of the Python install tree, wherever that resides on the target machine).\\n\\n## Module Coding Basics\\n### Module Filenames\\nThe .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported.\\n\\nIn fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in\\npackage imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented.\\n\\n**import** fetches the module as a whole, so you\\nmust qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, **from** fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, the from ...* statement form described here can be used\\nonly at the top level of a module file, not within a function.\\n\\nJust like def, import and from are executable statements, not compile-time declarations. They may be nested in if tests, to select among options; appear in function defs, to be loaded only on calls (subject to the preceding note); be used in try statements, to provide defaults; and so on.\\n```\\n>>> from small import x, y # Copy two names out\\n>>> x = 42 # Changes local x only\\n>>> y[0] = 42 # Changes shared mutable in place\\n```\\n\\nAt least conceptually, a from statement like this one:\\n```\\nfrom module import name1, name2 # Copy these two names out (only)\\n```\\nis equivalent to this statement sequence:\\n\\n```\\nimport module # Fetch the module object\\nname1 = module.name1 # Copy names out by assignment\\nname2 = module.name2\\ndel module # Get rid of the module name\\n```\\n\\nThe **from** always imports the entire module into memory if it has not yet been imported, regardless of how many names it copies out of the file. There is no way to load just part of a module file.\\n\\nMoreover, the from module import * form really can corrupt namespaces and make names difficult to understand, especially when applied to more than one file.\\n\\nProbably the best real-world advice here is to generally prefer import to from for simple modules, to explicitly list the variables you want in most from statements, and to limit the from * form to just one import per file.\\n\\nThe **as** extension works in both import and from as a simple renaming tool.\\n\\nIn fact, internally, module namespaces are stored as dictionary objects.\\n\\nThe LEGB scope rule applies only to bare, unqualified names—it may be used for the leftmost name in a name path, but later names after dots search specific objects instead.\\n\\nlexical scoping notion—in Python, the scopes surrounding\\na piece of code are completely determined by the code’s physical position in your file. Scopes are never influenced by function calls or module imports.\\n\\nimport operations never give upward visibility to code in imported files\\n—an imported file cannot see names in the importing file. In some sense, although imports do not nest namespaces upward, they do nest downward.\\n```\\nprint(mod2.mod3.X) # Nested mod3's X\\n```\\n\\n### Reloading Modules\\nThe **reload** function forces an already loaded module’s code to be reloaded and rerun. Assignments in the file’s new code change the existing module object in place.\\n\\n> Note that reload currently only works on modules\\nwritten in Python;\\n\\nBecause reload expects an object, a module must have been previously imported successfully before you can reload it.\\n\\nWhen you call reload, Python rereads the module file’s source code and reruns its toplevel statements. Perhaps the most important thing to know about reload is that it changes a module object in place; it does not delete and re-create the module object.\\n- Reloads impact all clients that use **import** to fetch modules\\n- Reloads impact future from clients only. Clients that used from to fetch attributes in the past won’t be affected by a reload; they’ll still have references to the old objects fetched before the reload.\\n- Reloads apply to a single module only.

Since the name of the main module is always \\\"__main__\\\", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.\\n\\nPython 3.3 adds another flavor to modules: *namespace packages*.\\n\\nPackages are just a special kind of module.

Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of obj \\n\\nThe Python Conceptual Hierarchy:\\n1. Programs are composed of modules.\\n2. Modules contain statements.\\n3. Statements contain expressions.\\n4. Expressions create and process objects.\\n\\n![Table 4-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-05-36.png)\\nIn formal terms, this means that Python is dynamically typed , a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also strongly typed, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type.\\n\\n## Core Types\\nImmutable: number, string, tuple, bytes \\nMutable: list, dictionary, set, bytearray\\n\\nPrimitive: number \\nCollection:\\n* Sequence: string, tuple, bytes, list, bytearray\\n* Mapping: dictionary, set\\n\\nbytearray is a distinct hybrid of immutable bytes strings (whose b'...' syntax is required in 3.X and optional in 2.X) and mutable lists (coded and displayed in [] ).\\n\\nGeneric operations that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g. `len(X)` , `X[0]` ), but type-specific operations are method calls (e.g., `aString.upper()` ).\\n\\nBoth `dir` and `help` also accept as arguments either a real object (like our string S) , or the name of a data type (like str , list , and dict ).\\n\\nAs a notable difference, Python 2.X allows its normal and Unicode strings to be mixed in expressions as long as the normal string is all ASCII; in contrast, Python 3.X has a tighter model that never allows its normal and byte strings to mix without explicit conversion.\\n\\nNone of the string object’s own methods support pattern-based text processing.\\n\\nUnlike out-of-bounds assignments in lists, which are forbidden, assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys, fetching a nonexistent key is still a mistake. (Use the get() method)\\n\\nA file’s contents are always a string in your script, regardless of the type of data the file contains:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> for line in open('data.txt'): print(line)\\n```\\n\\t\\nText files represent content as normal str strings and perform unicode encoding and decoding automatically when writing and reading data, while binary files represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered.\\n\\nSets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects.\\nDecimal, Fraction, booleans\\n\\nAs you’ll learn, in Python, we code to object interfaces (operations supported), not to types.\\n\\n## Numbers\\n![Table 5-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-09-34.png)\\n\\nFloating-point numbers are implemented as C “doubles” in standard CPython, and therefore get as much precision as the C compiler used to build the Python interpreter gives to doubles.\\n\\nbuilt-in calls: `hex(I)`, `oct(I)`, `bin(I)`, `int(str,base)`, `X.bit_length()`, `round(X)`, `X.as_integer_ratio()`\\n\\nInternally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers\\n\\n![Table 5-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-10-38.png)\\n\\nComparison operators may be chained: X < Y < Z produces the same result as X < Y and Y < Z .\\n```python\\n>>> 1 == 2 < 3 # Same as: 1 == 2 and 2 < 3\\nFalse # Not same as: False < 3 (which means 0 < 3, which is true!)\\n```\\n\\t\\nIn recent Pythons, the slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)].\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons are not allowed and raise exceptions; this includes sorts by proxy.\\n\\n* Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so bind more tightly in mixed expressions.\\n* Operators in the same row in Table 5-2 generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right).\\n\\nBesides mixing operators in expressions, you can also mix numeric types: \\nin mixed-type numeric expressions, Python first converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand, and then performs the math on same-type operands. Python ranks the complexity of numeric types like so: integers are simpler than floating point numbers, which are simpler than complex numbers. \\nIn general, Python does not convert across any other type boundaries automatically. Adding a string to an integer, for example, results in an error, unless you manually convert one or the other.\\n\\n In 3.X, the / now always performs true division, returning a float result that includes any remainder, regardless of operand types. The // performs floor division, which truncates the remainder and returns an integer for integer operands or a float if any operand is a float.\\n\\nThe // operator truncates the result down to its floor, which means the closest whole number below the true result.\\n\\nFrozenset\\n\\nInternally, the names True and False are instances of bool , which is in turn just a subclass (in the object oriented sense) of the built-in integer type int . True and False behave exactly like the integers 1 and 0, except that they have customized printing logic.\\n```\\n>>> True + 4 # (Hmmm)\\n5\\n```\\n\\t\\nNumpy, Scipy\\n\\t\\nThe dynamic typing\\nA variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.\\n\\nVariables always link to objects and never to other variables, but larger objects may link to other objects (for instance, a list object has links to the objects it contains).\\nThese links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory\\n\\nTechnically speaking, objects have more structure than just enough space to represent their values. Each object also has two standard header fields: a type designator used to mark the type of the object, and a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object.\\n\\nreference counter, cyclic reference\\n\\tsys.getrefcount(X)\\n\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in expression, they are copied. e.g. after b=a[:3], b refers to a new object.\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in left side of assignment, they referred to the original object. e.g. after a=[0,1,2] a[:] = [0,1], a becomes [0,1]\\n\\n Because everything seems to work by assignment and references\\nin Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. As you’ll see, it works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python;\\n\\nweakref\\n\\n## String\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-12-13-34.png)\\n\\n![Table 7-1]($resource/2018-09-03-16-34-23.png)\\nString literal forms:\\n* Single quotes: 'spa\\\"m'\\n* Double quotes: \\\"spa'm\\\"\\n* Triple quotes: '''... spam ...''' , \\\"\\\"\\\"... spam ...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n* Escape sequences: \\\"s\\\\tp\\\\na\\\\0m\\\"\\n* Raw strings: r\\\"C:\\\\new\\\\test.spm\\\"\\n* Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): b'sp\\\\x01am'\\n* Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): u'eggs\\\\u0020spam'\\n\\nIn fact, 3.X defines str strings formally as sequences of Unicode code\\npoints, not bytes, to make this clear.

Because it can be a bit complex, it is perhaps best thought of as a combination of two steps:\\n1. Deletion. The slice you specify to the left of the = is deleted.\\n2. Insertion. The new items contained in the iterable object to the right of the = are inserted into the list on the left, at the place where the old slice was deleted.\\nNote, L[2:5]=L[3:6], for instance, works fine because the value to be inserted is fetched before the deletion\\nhappens on the left.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1]\\n>>> L[:0] = [2, 3, 4] # Insert all at :0, an empty slice at front\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1]\\n>>> L[len(L):] = [5, 6, 7] # Insert all at len(L):, an empty slice at end\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]\\n>>> L.extend([8, 9, 10]) # Insert all at end, named method\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\n\\t\\nThe effect of `L.append(X)` is similar to `L+[X]`, but while the former changes L in place, the latter makes a new list.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, this has changed: magnitude comparison of mixed types\\nraises an exception instead of falling back on the fixed cross-type ordering.\\n\\nL.sort() vs. sorted\\nbuilt-in tools: reversed\\n\\nLike lists, dictionaries store object references (not copies, unless you ask for them explicitly)\\n\\n![Table 8-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-20.png)\\n\\nkeys in 3.X returns an iterable object, instead of a physical list\\nUnlike lists, however, whenever you assign a new dictionary key (one that hasn’t been assigned before) you create a new entry in the dictionary.\\n\\nIn 3.X the dictionary keys , values , and items methods all return view objects , whereas in 2.X they return actual result lists. \\nBesides being iterable, dictionary views also retain the original order of dictionary components, reflect future changes to the dictionary, and may support set operations. Unlike 2.X’s list results, though, dictionary views in 3.X are not carved in stone when created—they dynamically reflect future changes made to the dictionary after the view object has been created:\\n\\n In set operations, views may be mixed with other views, sets, and dictionaries; dictionaries\\nare treated the same as their keys views in this context:\\n```\\n>>> D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\\n>>> D.keys() & D.keys() # Intersect keys views\\n{'b', 'c', 'a'}\\n>>> D.keys() & {'b'} # Intersect keys and set\\n{'b'}\\n>>> D.\\n```\\n\\n```\\n>>> Ks.sort()\\nAttributeError: 'dict_keys' object has no attribute 'sort'\\n```\\nTo work around this, in 3.X you must either convert to a list manually or use the\\nsorted call (introduced in Chapter 4 and covered in this chapter) on either a keys view\\nor the dictionary itself:\\n\\nOrderedDict\\n\\n## Tuples, files and everything else\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-16-36-56.png)\\n![Table 9-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-57.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, named tuples are a tuple/class/dictionary hybrid\\n (In short, named tuples build new classes that extend the tuple type, inserting a property accessor method for each named field that maps the name to its position)\\n \\n![Table 9-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-03-26.png)\\n\\nEmpty lines in the file come back as strings containing just a newline character, not as empty strings.\\n```\\n>>> myfile.readline() # Empty string: end-of-file\\n''\\n```\\n\\t\\n* Text files represent content as normal str strings, perform Unicode encoding and decoding automatically, and perform end-of-line translation by default.\\n* Binary files represent content as a special bytes string type and allow programs to access file content unaltered.\\n\\npickle, shelve, json, struct\\n\\n In fact, when nested objects are present, Python automatically\\ntraverses data structures to apply comparisons from left to right, and as deeply as\\nneeded.\\n\\n More specifically, Python compares types as follows:\\n- Numbers are compared by relative magnitude, after conversion to the common highest type if needed.\\n- Strings are compared lexicographically (by the character set code point values returned by `ord` ), and character by character until the end or first mismatch (\\\"abc\\\"< \\\"ac\\\" ).\\n- Lists and tuples are compared by comparing each component from left to right, and recursively for nested structures, until the end or first mismatch ([2] > [1, 2] ).\\n- Sets are equal if both contain the same items (formally, if each is a subset of the other), and set relative magnitude comparisons apply subset and superset tests.\\n- Dictionaries compare as equal if their sorted (key, value) lists are equal. Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X, but they work in 2.X as though comparing sorted (key, value) lists.\\n- Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 < 'spam' ) are errors in Python 3.X. They are allowed in Python 2.X, but use a fixed but arbitrary ordering rule based on type name string. By proxy, this also applies to sorts, which use comparisons internally: nonnumeric mixed-type collections cannot be sorted in 3.X.\\n\\nPython 3.X disallows mixed-type magnitude testing, except numeric types.\\n\\nMore generally, the notions of true and false are intrinsic properties of every object in Python—each object is either true or false, as follows:\\n- Numbers are false if zero, and true otherwise.\\n- Other objects are false if empty, and true otherwise.\\n\\n That is, *None* is something, not nothing (despite its name!)—it is a real object and a real piece of memory that is created and given a built-in name by Python itself.\\n\\n In fact, even types themselves are an object type in Python.\\n Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage.\\n\\nFor classic classes in Python 2.X, all class instances are instead of the type “instance,” and we must compare instance `__class__` attributes to compare their types meaningfully.\\n\\nRepetition Adds One Level Deep\\n```python\\n>>> L = [4, 5, 6]\\n>>> X = L * 4 # Like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...\\n>>> Y = [L] * 4 # [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...]\\n```\\n\\t\\nIf you remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much more sense\\n\\nBeware of Cyclic Data Structure\\n```python\\n>>> L = ['grail'] # Append reference to same object\\n>>> L.append(L) # Generates cycle in object: [...]\\n>>> L\\n['grail', [...]]\\n```\\n\\n# Statements and Syntax\\n## Assignments, Expressions, and Prints\\n- Assignments create object references. (i.e. link a name with an object) They always create references to objects instead of copying the objects.\\n- Names are created when first assigned.\\n- Names must be assigned before referenced.\\n\\nModule imports, function and class definitions, for loop variables, and function arguments are all implicit assignments.\\n\\n![Table 11-1]($resource/2018-09-03-13-40-51.png)\\n\\nsequence assignment—any sequence of names can be\\nassigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items one at a time by position. In fact, the original tuple and list assignment forms in Python have been generalized to accept any type of sequence (really, iterable) on the right as long as it is of the same length as the sequence on the left.\\n\\nMultiple-target assignment: Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object farthest to the right) to all the targets on the left.\\n\\nIn tuple/list assignment, Python creates a temporary tuple that saves the original values of the variables on the right before assigning.\\n\\nwe can even assign nested sequences, and Python unpacks their parts according to their shape, as expected. The sequence-nesting shape of the object on the left must match that of the object on the right.\\n> This nested tuple (really, sequence) unpacking\\nassignment form works for function argument lists in Python 2.X (though not in 3.X)\\n\\nIn short, a single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target in order to specify a more general matching against the sequence—the starred name is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names. In fact, the starred name can appear anywhere in the target.\\n> This is similar in spirit to slicing, but not exactly the same—a sequence unpacking assignment always returns a list for multiple matched items, whereas slicing returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced\\n```\\n>>> a, *b = 'spam'\\n>>> a, b\\n('s', ['p', 'a', 'm'])\\n>>> S[0], S[1:] # Slices are type-specific, * assignment always returns a list\\n('s', 'pam')\\n```\\n\\nFinally, errors can still be triggered if there is more than one starred name, if there are too few values and no star (as before), and if the starred name is not itself coded inside a sequence:\\n```\\n>>> *a = seq\\nSyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple\\n```\\n\\nFor augmented assignments, inplace operations may be applied for mutable objects as an optimization.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1, 2]\\n>>> L = L + [3] # Concatenate: slower\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> L.append(4) # Faster, but in place\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\n>>> L += [9, 10] # Mapped to L.extend([9, 10])\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\nNote however, that because of this equivalence += for a list is not exactly the same as a + and = in all cases—for lists += allows arbitrary sequences (just like extend), but concatenation normally does not:\\n```\\n>>> L = []\\n>>> L += 'spam' # += and extend allow any sequence, but + does not!\\n>>> L\\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\\n>>> L = L + 'spam'\\nTypeError: can only concatenate list (not \\\"str\\\") to list\\n```\\n> Although Python now supports statements like X += Y, it still does not\\nhave C’s auto-increment/decrement operators (e.g., X++, −−X).\\n\\n### Naming\\nFor portability, case also matters in the names of imported module files, even on platforms where the filesystems are case-insensitive.\\n\\nTrue, False, and None, are somewhat unusual in meaning—they also appear in the built-in scope of Python described in Chapter 17, and they are technically names assigned to objects.\\n\\nNames that begin with a single underscore (_X) are not imported by a from module import * statement\\n\\nNames that begin with two underscores and do not end with two more (__X) are localized (“mangled”) to enclosing classes.\\n\\n### Expression Statements\\nIn Python, you can use an expression as a statement, too. Expressions are commonly used as statements in two situations:\\n- For calls to functions and methods\\n- For printing values at the interactive prompt\\n\\nA statement that is not an expression must generally appear on a line all by itself, not nested in a larger syntactic structure. For example, Python doesn’t allow you to embed assignment statements (=) in other expressions. Besides, C assignments return the value assigned, but Python assignments are just statements, not expressions.\\n\\nExpression statements are often used to run list methods that change a list in place:\\n```\\n>>> L = L.append(4) # But append returns None, not L\\n>>> print(L) # So we lose our list!\\nNone\\n```\\n\\nNormally, whether printed output is buffered in memory or not is determined by file; passing a true value to flush forcibly flushes the stream.\\n\\nBecause the print statement just sends text to the sys.stdout.write method, you can capture printed text in your programs by assigning sys.stdout to an object whose write method processes the text in arbitrary ways\\n\\n## if Tests and Syntax Rules\\nThere is no switch or case statement in Python\\n\\n* Block and statement boundaries are detected automatically.\\n* Compound statements = header + “:” + indented statements. \\n* Blank lines, spaces, and comments are usually ignored.\\n* Docstrings are ignored but are saved and displayed by tools.\\n\\nStatements may span multiple lines if you’re continuing an open syntactic\\npair.\\n\\nBoolean operators stop evaluating (“short circuit”) as soon as a result is known. Boolean **and** and **or** operators return a true or false object in Python, not the values True or False\\n\\nFor `A = Y if X else Z`, Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false.\\n\\nWhen defining classes, we can specify their Boolean nature with either the\\n__bool__ or __len__ methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n## while and for Loops\\nThe optional **else** block run if didn't exit loop with **break**\\n\\nPython doesn’t have what some languages call a “do until” loop statement. Python has no \\\"go to\\\" statement.\\n\\nPython 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as ... (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the pass statement,\\n```\\n>>> X = ... # Alternative to None\\n>>> X\\nEllipsis\\n```\\n\\nAfter the **for** loop, this loop variable normally still refers to the last item visited, which is the last item in the sequence unless the loop exits with a break statement.\\n\\nEven nested structures may be automatically unpacked this way in a for:\\n```\\n>>> for ((a, b), c) in [((1, 2), 3), ((4, 5), 6)]: print(a, b, c)\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, as a general rule, you should resist the temptation to count things in Python—its iteration tools automate much of the work you do to loop over collections in lower-level languages like C.\\n\\nbuilt-in tools: range, zip, enumerate\\n\\nThe zip function is more general than this example suggests. For instance,\\nit accepts any type of sequence (really, any iterable object, including files), and it accepts more than two arguments. Moreover, zip truncates result tuples at the length of the shortest sequence when the argument lengths differ.\\n\\n## Iterations and Comprehensions\\n* Iterator vs. Iterable vs. Iteration tool/context\\n* Single scan vs. multiple scan\\n\\nIn some cases these two objects are the same when only a single scan is supported (e.g., files), and the iterator object is often temporary, used internally by the iteration tool. Moreover, some objects are both an iteration context tool (they iterate) and an iterable object (their results are iterable)—including Chapter 20’s generator expressions, and map and zip in Python 3.X.\\n\\nWhen the for loop begins, it first obtains an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the iter built-in function; the object returned by iter in turn has the required next method. The iter function internally runs the __iter__ method, much like `next` and `__next__`.\\n\\nFor comprehensions, their full syntax allows for any number of **for** clauses, each of which can have an optional associated **if** clause.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that every built-in tool that scans from left to right across objects uses the iteration protocol.\\n\\nNotice that, unlike map and others, sorted returns an actual list in Python 3.X\\ninstead of an iterable.\\n\\nOne of the fundamental distinctions of Python 3.X is its stronger emphasis on iterators than 2.X. This, along with its Unicode model and mandated new-style classes, is one of 3.X’s most sweeping changes.\\n\\nUnlike **range**, **map**, **zip**, **filter** are their own iterators—after you step through their results once, they are exhausted.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X the dictionary keys, values, and items methods return iterable view objects that generate result items one at a time.\\n\\n## Documentation Interlude\\nThe PyDoc system covered here can render a module’s internal documentation as either plain text in a shell, or HTML in a web browser.\\n\\nThe **help** function: press the space bar to move to the next page, Enter to go to the next line, and Q to quit:\\n\\nSphinx\\n\\n# Functions and Generators\\n## Function Basics\\n* *def* is executable code. it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other *def*s.\\n* *def* creates an object and assigns it to a name. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined *attributes* attached to them to record data.\\n\\nNames are always looked up in *scopes*—places where variables are stored— and assignments bind names to scopes.\\n\\n>Files must generally be rewound (e.g., with a file.seek(0) or another\\nopen) after they have been read to end-of-file once, and so are single-pass iterators\\n\\n## Scopes\\nWhen we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term\\nscope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source\\ncode determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code.\\n\\nBy default, all names assigned inside a function are associated with that function’s namespace, and no other.\\n\\nLexical scoping:\\n- If a variable is assigned inside a def, it is local to that function.\\n- If a variable is assigned in an enclosing def, it is nonlocal to nested functions.\\n- If a variable is assigned outside all defs, it is global to the entire file.\\n\\nEach module is a global scope, the global scope spans a single file only.\\n* Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal\\n* All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins.\\n* Each call to a function creates a new local scope.\\n\\n> Note `L=X` within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not.\\n\\n### Name Resolution: The LEGB Rule\\n- Name assignments create or change local names by default.\\n- Name references search at most four scopes: local, then enclosing functions (if any), then global, then built-in.\\n- Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes, respectively.\\n\\nNote that the second scope lookup layer, E—the scopes of enclosing defs or lambdas—can technically correspond to more than one lookup level.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that these rules apply only to simple variable names (e.g., spam). Qualified attribute names (e.g., object.spam) live in particular objects and follow a completely different set of lookup rules than those covered here.\\n\\nThere are technically three more scopes in Python—temporary loop variables in some comprehensions, exception reference variables in some try handlers, and local scopes in class statements\\n\\nIn 3.X, the loop variables are local to the expression itself in all comprehension forms: generator, list, set, and dictionary. In 2.X, they are local to generator expressions and set and dictionary compressions, but not to list comprehensions that map their names to the scope outside the expression. By contrast, for loop statements never localize their variables to the statement block in any Python.\\n\\nIn 3.X, exception reference variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!).\\n\\nAlthough the LEGB rule is used to resolve\\nnames used in both the top level of a class itself as well as the top level of method functions nested within it, classes themselves are skipped by scope lookups—their names must be fetched as object attributes.\\n\\n### The global/nonlocal Statement\\nThe global statement consists of the keyword global, followed by one or more names separated by commas. All the listed names will be mapped to the enclosing module’s scope when assigned or referenced within the function body. \\n```\\nglobal x\\n```\\n\\nThe name x do not need even exist in the enclosing module\\nbefore the function runs; in this case, the first assignment in the function creates x in the module.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, X is declared nonlocal within the function in 3.X (only), the assignment changes the name X in the closest enclosing function’s local scope. The name X must have been defined in at least one enclosing function.\\n\\n```\\ndef f1():\\nx = 88\\ndef f2(x=x): # Remember enclosing scope X with defaults\\nprint(x)\\nf2()\\nf1() # Prints 88\\n```\\nBecause the second x is evaluated before Python steps into the nested def, it still refers to the x in f1.\\n```\\ndef func():\\nx = 4\\naction = (lambda n, x=x: x ** n) # Pass x in manually\\nreturn action\\n```\\nLoop variables may require defaults, not scopes, Compare\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Tries to remember each i\\nacts.append(lambda x: i ** x) # But all remember same last i!\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nwith\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Use defaults instead\\nacts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x) # Remember current i\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nBecause defaults are implemented as single objects attached to functions, mutable defaults retain state from call to call, rather than being initialized anew on each call.\\n\\nUnlike global, nonlocal names must already exist in the enclosing function’s scope when declared. In fact, they are checked at function definition time before either an enclosing or nested function is called.\\n\\nNonlocal both allows assignment to names in enclosing function scopes and limits scope lookups for such names to enclosing defs.\\n\\nPython uses naming conventions in both 2.X and 3.X that ensure that the arbitrary names you assign as function attributes won’t clash with names related to internal implementation.\\n\\nTo summarize: globals, nonlocals, classes, and function attributes all offer changeable state-retention options.\\n\\n## Arguments\\nIn Python 2.X, it’s also possible to automatically unpack tuples in arguments passed to a function.\\n```\\ndef f((a,(b,c)))\\n```\\nThis def syntax is no longer supported in Python 3.X. Instead, code this function as:\\n```\\ndef f(T): (a, (b, c)) = T\\n```\\nTuple unpacking argument syntax is also disallowed by 3.X in lambda\\nfunction argument lists. Somewhat asymmetrically, tuple unpacking assignment is still automatic in 3.X for loops targets\\n\\nBy default, arguments are matched by position, from left to right, and you must pass exactly as many arguments as there are argument names in the function header.\\n\\n![Table 18-1]($resource/2018-09-04-20-04-02.png)\\n\\nIn a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments or the *iterable form, followed by any keyword arguments or the **dict form. If we see *iterable and **dict as being unpacked to positional arguments and keyword arguments, the order becomes: any positional arguments, followed by any keyword arguments. In a broad sense, there are only two arguments: positional and keyword.\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g):\\n print('ok')\\nb=[2]\\nx = {'d':4,'e':5}\\ny = {'f':6}\\nfoo(1,*b,3,**x,g=7,**y) //ok\\n```\\n> In a function header, we use the term \\\"parameter\\\" instead of \\\"argument\\\"\\n\\nIn a function header, parameters must appear in this order: any normal parameter(name); followed by any default parameters (name=value); followed by the *name (or \\\\* in 3.X) form; followed by any name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form\\n\\nWe can use a * character by itself in the arguments list to indicate that a function does not accept a variable-length argument list but still expects all arguments following the * to be passed as keywords.\\n\\nThe *name=value* form has two meaning:\\n- before the form *name, it's positional with default value\\n- after the form *name, it's keyword-only with default value\\n\\nThere can be at most one *name parameter, which collects all remaining positional arguments (including those in *iterabe). Similarly, There can be at most one *\\\\*dict parameter, which collects all remaining keyword arguments (including those in *\\\\*dict arguments).\\n\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b=3,*c,d,**e):\\n print(b,e)\\nx = [3,4]\\ny = {'d':5,'e':6,'f':7}\\nfoo(1,2,*x,**y) # 2 {'e': 6, 'f': 7}\\n```\\nThe steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before\\nassignment can roughly be described as follows:\\n1. Assign nonkeyword arguments by position.\\n2. Assign keyword arguments by matching names.\\n3. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple.\\n4. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary.\\n5. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header.\\n\\n> Note that in both function call and header, the *name = value* form are not assignments.\\n\\nThe default parameters are attached to function objects, if you code\\na default to be a mutable object (e.g., def f(a=[])), the same, single\\nmutable object is reused every time the function is later called—even if\\nit is changed in place within the function.\\n\\nBelow is a tracer function example:\\n```\\ndef tracer(func, *pargs, **kargs): # Accept arbitrary arguments\\n print('calling:', func.__name__)\\n return func(*pargs, **kargs) # Pass along arbitrary arguments\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Function Topics\\nIn fact, recursion is not used nearly as often in Python as in\\nmore esoteric languages like Prolog or Lisp, because Python emphasizes simpler procedural statements like loops, which are usually more natural.\\n\\nOn the other hand, recursion—or equivalent explicit stack-based algorithms we’ll meet shortly—can be required to traverse arbitrarily shaped structures.\\n\\nAlso note that standard Python limits the depth of its runtime call stack—crucial to recursive call programs—to trap infinite recursion errors. To expand it, use the **sys** module:\\n```\\n>>> sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default\\n1000\\n>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting\\n>>> help(sys.setrecursionlimit) # Read more about it\\n```\\n\\n### Function attributes and annotations\\n```\\n>>> func.__code__\\n>>> func.__code__.co_varnames\\n```\\nPython’s own implementation-related data stored on functions follows naming conventions that prevent them from clashing with the more arbitrary attribute names you might assign yourself. In 3.X, all function internals’ names have leading and trailing double underscores (“_\\\\_X__”);\\n\\nAttributes are related to objects instead of scopes (and must be referenced through the function name within its code).\\n\\nPython provides special syntax for specifying annotations, but it doesn’t do anything with them itself; annotations are completely optional, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s __annotations__ attribute for use by other tools. Syntactically, function annotations are coded in def header lines, as arbitrary expressions associated with arguments and return values.\\n```\\n>>> def func(a: 'spam', b: (1, 10), c: float) -> int:\\nreturn a + b + c\\n>>> func(1, 2, 3)\\n6\\n>>> func.__annotations__\\n{'c': , 'b': (1, 10), 'a': 'spam', 'return': }\\n```\\n\\nFinally, note that annotations work only in def statements, not lambda expressions.\\n\\n- **lambda** is an expression, not a statement.\\n- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.\\n- Defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def.\\n- The code in a lambda body also follows the same scope lookup rules as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope (via the LEGB rule)\\n\\n```\\n>>> ((lambda x: (lambda y: x + y))(99))(4)\\n103\\n```\\n\\nuseful library: functools, operator\\n\\n## Comprehensions and Generations\\nmap calls can be twice as fast as equivalent for loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than map calls.\\n\\nGenerator function vs. Generator vs. Generator expression\\n- *send* advances to the next item \\n- *yield* is now an expression form, it must be enclose in parentheses unless it's the only item on the right ride of the assignment statement.\\n- methods: *throw*, *close*\\n- *yield from*\\n\\nGenerator expressions may also run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation.\\n\\nA subtle but important point: both generator functions and generator expressions are their own iterators and thus support just one active iteration.\\n\\nPython 3.X localizes loop variables in all four forms—temporary loop variable names in generator, set, dictionary, and list comprehensions are local to the expression.\\n\\nIn general, list comprehensions are usually the quickest of the bunch; map beats list comprehensions in Python only when all tools must call functions; for loops tend to be slower than comprehensions; and generator functions and expressions are slower than comprehensions by a constant factor. Under\\n\\n## The benchmarking Interlude\\nTimeing modules: time, timer, profile, timeit, pystone.py\\n\\n# Part V. Modules and Packages\\nModules are processed with two statements and one important function:\\n- import: Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole\\n- from: Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module\\n- imp.reload (reload in 2.X): Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python\\n\\nIn Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved until such import statements are executed at runtime; their net effect is to assign module names—simple variables like b—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module name used in an import statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external file to be loaded, but it also becomes a variable assigned to the loaded module.\\n\\nSimilarly, objects defined by a module are also created at runtime, as the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents.\\n\\nIn python, imports perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\\n1. Find the module’s file.\\n2. Compile it to byte code (if needed).\\n3. Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines.\\n\\nBear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named **sys.mod** ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins. (see **imp.reload**)\\n> Python keeps already imported modules in the built-in **sys.modules** dictionary so it can keep track of what’s been loaded.\\n\\nNotice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your machine.\\n\\n### The Module Search Path\\nRoughly, Python’s module search path is composed of the concatenation of these major components, some of which are preset for you and some of which you can tailor to tell Python where to look:\\n1. The home directory of the program (subdirectories not included)\\n2. PYTHONPATH directories (if set)\\n3. Standard library directories\\n4. The contents of any .pth files (if present)\\n5. The site-packages home of third-party extensions\\n\\nUltimately, the concatenation of these four components becomes **sys.path**, a mutable list of directory. The first and\\nthird elements of the search path are defined automatically. Because Python searches the concatenation of these components from first to last, though, the second and fourth elements can be used to extend the path to include your own source code directories.\\n\\nBy modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a program’s run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path—the first per user, and the second per installation.\\n\\nPython automatically selects any type that matches a module’s name. For same names with different extensions, Python follows a standard picking order, though this order is not guaranteed to stay the same over time or across implementations. \\n\\nBy using import hooks, archived files are automatically extracted at import time when a .zip file is selected from the module import search path.\\n\\nFor details, see the builtin **importlib._\\\\_import__** function\\n\\nThird-party extensions for Python typically use the **distutils** tools in the standard library to automatically install themselves, so no path configuration is required to use their code.\\n\\nSystems that use distutils generally come with a setup.py script, which is run to install them; this script imports and uses distutils modules to place such systems in a directory that is automatically part of the module search path (usually in the Lib\\\\site-packages subdirectory of the Python install tree, wherever that resides on the target machine).\\n\\n## Module Coding Basics\\n### Module Filenames\\nThe .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported.\\n\\nIn fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in\\npackage imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented.\\n\\n**import** fetches the module as a whole, so you\\nmust qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, **from** fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, the from ...* statement form described here can be used\\nonly at the top level of a module file, not within a function.\\n\\nJust like def, import and from are executable statements, not compile-time declarations. They may be nested in if tests, to select among options; appear in function defs, to be loaded only on calls (subject to the preceding note); be used in try statements, to provide defaults; and so on.\\n```\\n>>> from small import x, y # Copy two names out\\n>>> x = 42 # Changes local x only\\n>>> y[0] = 42 # Changes shared mutable in place\\n```\\n\\nAt least conceptually, a from statement like this one:\\n```\\nfrom module import name1, name2 # Copy these two names out (only)\\n```\\nis equivalent to this statement sequence:\\n\\n```\\nimport module # Fetch the module object\\nname1 = module.name1 # Copy names out by assignment\\nname2 = module.name2\\ndel module # Get rid of the module name\\n```\\n\\nThe **from** always imports the entire module into memory if it has not yet been imported, regardless of how many names it copies out of the file. There is no way to load just part of a module file.\\n\\nMoreover, the from module import * form really can corrupt namespaces and make names difficult to understand, especially when applied to more than one file.\\n\\nProbably the best real-world advice here is to generally prefer import to from for simple modules, to explicitly list the variables you want in most from statements, and to limit the from * form to just one import per file.\\n\\nThe **as** extension works in both import and from as a simple renaming tool.\\n\\nIn fact, internally, module namespaces are stored as dictionary objects.\\n\\nThe LEGB scope rule applies only to bare, unqualified names—it may be used for the leftmost name in a name path, but later names after dots search specific objects instead.\\n\\nlexical scoping notion—in Python, the scopes surrounding\\na piece of code are completely determined by the code’s physical position in your file. Scopes are never influenced by function calls or module imports.\\n\\nimport operations never give upward visibility to code in imported files\\n—an imported file cannot see names in the importing file. In some sense, although imports do not nest namespaces upward, they do nest downward.\\n```\\nprint(mod2.mod3.X) # Nested mod3's X\\n```\\n\\n### Reloading Modules\\nThe **reload** function forces an already loaded module’s code to be reloaded and rerun. Assignments in the file’s new code change the existing module object in place.\\n\\n> Note that reload currently only works on modules\\nwritten in Python;\\n\\nBecause reload expects an object, a module must have been previously imported successfully before you can reload it.\\n\\nWhen you call reload, Python rereads the module file’s source code and reruns its toplevel statements. Perhaps the most important thing to know about reload is that it changes a module object in place; it does not delete and re-create the module object.\\n- Reloads impact all clients that use **import** to fetch modules\\n- Reloads impact future from clients only. Clients that used from to fetch attributes in the past won’t be affected by a reload; they’ll still have references to the old objects fetched before the reload.\\n- Reloads apply to a single module only. You must run them on each module you wish to update, unless you use code or tools that apply reloads transitively.\\n\\n## Module Packages\\nDotted package \\n**from package import item**: the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable.\\n**import item.subitem.subitem**: each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can't be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.\\n\\nTow kinds of imports:\\n- absolute imports\\n- relative imports\\n\\nIn sum, Python imports select between relative (in the containing directory) and absolute (in a directory on sys.path) resolutions as follows:\\n- Dotted imports: from . import m \\nAre relative-only in both 2.X and 3.X\\n- Nondotted imports: import m, from m import x \\nAre relative-then-absolute in 2.X, and absolute-only in 3.X\\n\\nNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always \\\"__main__\\\", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.\\n\\nPython 3.3 adds another flavor to modules: *namespace packages*.\\n\\nPackages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package.\\n\\nTwo kinds of packages:\\n* regular packages\\n* namespace packages\",[[1565836016767,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,4238,\"\\n\"]],[4237,4237],[4238,4238]]],[1565836026215,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,3927,\"\\n\"]],[3928,3928],[3927,3927]]],[1565836028795,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,3927,\" \"]],[3927,3927],[3928,3928]]],[1565836030139,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,3927,\" \"]],[3928,3928],[3927,3927]]],[1565837113060,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,5519,\" \"]],[5520,5520],[5519,5519]]],[1565837113839,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,5519,\" \"]],[5519,5519],[5520,5520]]],[1565837164790,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,6072,\"`\"]],[6072,6072],[6073,6073]]],[1565837167488,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,6091,\"`\"]],[6091,6091],[6092,6092]]],[1565837214217,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,6400,\"\\n\"]],[6401,6401],[6400,6400]]],[1565837214875,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,6400,\" \"]],[6400,6400],[6401,6401]]],[1565837239112,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,6569,\" \"]],[6570,6570],[6569,6569]]],[1565837295715,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,0,\"---\\ntitle: Notes for Learning Python 5th\\n---\"]],[0,44],[0,0]]],[1565837297153,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,0,\"\\n\"]],[1,1],[0,0]]],[1565837301090,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,0,\"[toc]\"]],[5,5],[0,0]]],[1565837303366,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,0,\"\\n\"]],[1,1],[0,0]]],[1565837305142,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,0,\"\\n\"]],[0,0],[1,1]]],[1565837307752,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,0,\"THis\"]],[0,0],[4,4]]],[1565837308449,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,1,\"His\"]],[4,4],[1,1]]],[1565837314827,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,1,\"his is my notes for \"]],[1,1],[21,21]]],[1565837316179,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,21,\"\\\"\"]],[21,21],[22,22]]],[1565837316262,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,21,\"\\\"\"],[1,22,\"“\"]],[22,22],[22,22]]],[1565837324986,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,22,\"Learning Ptyhon(5th)\"]],[22,22],[42,42]]],[1565837326642,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,37,\" \"]],[37,37],[38,38]]],[1565837328323,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,43,\"\\\"\"]],[43,43],[44,44]]],[1565837328476,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,43,\"\\\"\"],[1,44,\"”\"]],[44,44],[44,44]]],[1565837335990,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,44,\".\"]],[44,44],[45,45]]],[1565837336628,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,46,\"\\n\"]],[45,45],[46,46]]],[1565841230903,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,48,\"#\"]],[48,48],[49,49]]],[1565841250288,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,726,\"#\"]],[726,726],[727,727]]],[1565841252723,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,726,\"#\"]],[727,727],[726,726]]],[1565841254965,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,48,\"#\"]],[48,48],[47,47]]],[1565841256155,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,47,\"\\n\"]],[46,46],[47,47]]],[1565841262614,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,47,\"# Introduction\"]],[47,47],[61,61]]],[1565841266442,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,47,\"# Introduction\"]],[61,61],[47,47]]],[1565841269956,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,47,\"# Prelima\"]],[47,47],[56,56]]],[1565841270473,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,55,\"a\"]],[56,56],[55,55]]],[1565841273875,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,55,\"inaries\"]],[55,55],[62,62]]],[1565841274989,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,63,\"\\n\"]],[62,62],[63,63]]],[1565841276905,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,64,\"\\n\"]],[63,63],[64,64]]],[1565841278239,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,64,\"\\n\"]],[64,64],[63,63]]],[1565841281145,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,63,\"```\"]],[63,63],[66,66]]],[1565841281792,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,67,\"\\n\"]],[66,66],[67,67]]],[1565841283492,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,67,\"```\"]],[67,67],[70,70]]],[1565841284136,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,67,\"\\n\"]],[66,66],[67,67]]],[1565841286164,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,67,\"d\"]],[67,67],[68,68]]],[1565841286884,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,67,\"d\"]],[68,68],[67,67]]],[1565841290143,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,67,\">>> dir()\"]],[67,67],[76,76]]],[1565841291814,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,77,\"\\n\"]],[76,76],[77,77]]],[1565841296619,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,77,\">>> dir(S)\"]],[77,77],[87,87]]],[1565841301873,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,76,\" #

Python always follows a reference to an object whenever the reference is used.\\n# Types and Operations\\nObjects are pieces of memory, with values and sets of associated operations. Everything we process in Python programs is a kind of obj \\n\\nThe Python Conceptual Hierarchy:\\n1. Programs are composed of modules.\\n2. Modules contain statements.\\n3. Statements contain expressions.\\n4. Expressions create and process objects.\\n\\n![Table 4-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-05-36.png)\\nIn formal terms, this means that Python is dynamically typed , a model that keeps track of types for you automatically instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also strongly typed, a constraint that means you can perform on an object only operations that are valid for its type.\\n\\n## Core Types\\nImmutable: number, string, tuple, bytes \\nMutable: list, dictionary, set, bytearray\\n\\nPrimitive: number \\nCollection:\\n* Sequence: string, tuple, bytes, list, bytearray\\n* Mapping: dictionary, set\\n\\nbytearray is a distinct hybrid of immutable bytes strings (whose b'...' syntax is required in 3.X and optional in 2.X) and mutable lists (coded and displayed in [] ).\\n\\nGeneric operations that span multiple types show up as built-in functions or expressions (e.g. `len(X)` , `X[0]` ), but type-specific operations are method calls (e.g., `aString.upper()` ).\\n\\nBoth `dir` and `help` also accept as arguments either a real object (like our string S) , or the name of a data type (like str , list , and dict ).\\n\\nAs a notable difference, Python 2.X allows its normal and Unicode strings to be mixed in expressions as long as the normal string is all ASCII; in contrast, Python 3.X has a tighter model that never allows its normal and byte strings to mix without explicit conversion.\\n\\nNone of the string object’s own methods support pattern-based text processing.\\n\\nUnlike out-of-bounds assignments in lists, which are forbidden, assignments to new dictionary keys create those keys, fetching a nonexistent key is still a mistake. (Use the get() method)\\n\\nA file’s contents are always a string in your script, regardless of the type of data the file contains:\\n\\n```python\\n>>> for line in open('data.txt'): print(line)\\n```\\n\\t\\nText files represent content as normal str strings and perform unicode encoding and decoding automatically when writing and reading data, while binary files represent content as a special bytes string and allow you to access file content unaltered.\\n\\nSets are unordered collections of unique and immutable objects.\\nDecimal, Fraction, booleans\\n\\nAs you’ll learn, in Python, we code to object interfaces (operations supported), not to types.\\n\\n## Numbers\\n![Table 5-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-09-34.png)\\n\\nFloating-point numbers are implemented as C “doubles” in standard CPython, and therefore get as much precision as the C compiler used to build the Python interpreter gives to doubles.\\n\\nbuilt-in calls: `hex(I)`, `oct(I)`, `bin(I)`, `int(str,base)`, `X.bit_length()`, `round(X)`, `X.as_integer_ratio()`\\n\\nInternally, complex numbers are implemented as pairs of floating-point numbers\\n\\n![Table 5-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-10-38.png)\\n\\nComparison operators may be chained: X < Y < Z produces the same result as X < Y and Y < Z .\\n```python\\n>>> 1 == 2 < 3 # Same as: 1 == 2 and 2 < 3\\nFalse # Not same as: False < 3 (which means 0 < 3, which is true!)\\n```\\n\\t\\nIn recent Pythons, the slice expression X[I:J:K] is equivalent to indexing with a slice object: X[slice(I, J, K)].\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons are not allowed and raise exceptions; this includes sorts by proxy.\\n\\n* Operators lower in the table have higher precedence, and so bind more tightly in mixed expressions.\\n* Operators in the same row in Table 5-2 generally group from left to right when combined (except for exponentiation, which groups right to left, and comparisons, which chain left to right).\\n\\nBesides mixing operators in expressions, you can also mix numeric types: in mixed-type numeric expressions, Python first converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand, and then performs the math on same-type operands. Python ranks the complexity of numeric types like so: integers are simpler than floating point numbers, which are simpler than complex numbers. \\n\\nIn general, Python does not convert across any other type boundaries automatically. Adding a string to an integer, for example, results in an error, unless you manually convert one or the other.\\n\\n In 3.X, the / now always performs true division, returning a float result that includes any remainder, regardless of operand types. The // performs floor division, which truncates the remainder and returns an integer for integer operands or a float if any operand is a float.\\n\\nThe // operator truncates the result down to its floor, which means the closest whole number below the true result.\\n\\nFrozenset\\n\\nInternally, the names True and False are instances of bool , which is in turn just a subclass (in the object oriented sense) of the built-in integer type int . True and False behave exactly like the integers 1 and 0, except that they have customized printing logic.\\n```\\n>>> True + 4 # (Hmmm)\\n5\\n```\\n\\t\\nNumpy, Scipy\\n\\t\\nThe dynamic typing\\nA variable never has any type information or constraints associated with it. The notion of type lives with objects, not names. Variables are generic in nature; they always simply refer to a particular object at a particular point in time.\\n\\nVariables always link to objects and never to other variables, but larger objects may link to other objects (for instance, a list object has links to the objects it contains).\\nThese links from variables to objects are called references in Python—that is, a reference is a kind of association, implemented as a pointer in memory\\n\\nTechnically speaking, objects have more structure than just enough space to represent their values. Each object also has two standard header fields: a type designator used to mark the type of the object, and a reference counter used to determine when it’s OK to reclaim the object.\\n\\nreference counter, cyclic reference\\n\\t`sys.getrefcount(X)`\\n\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in expression, they are copied. e.g. after b=a[:3], b refers to a new object.\\nIf a[:], a[k] appears in left side of assignment, they referred to the original object. e.g. after a=[0,1,2] a[:] = [0,1], a becomes [0,1]\\n\\n Because everything seems to work by assignment and references in Python, a basic understanding of this model is useful in many different contexts. As you’ll see, it works the same in assignment statements, function arguments, for loop variables, module imports, class attributes, and more. The good news is that there is just one assignment model in Python;\\n\\nweakref\\n\\n## String\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-12-13-34.png)\\n\\n![Table 7-1]($resource/2018-09-03-16-34-23.png)\\nString literal forms:\\n* Single quotes: 'spa\\\"m'\\n* Double quotes: \\\"spa'm\\\"\\n* Triple quotes: '''... spam ...''' , \\\"\\\"\\\"... spam ...\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n* Escape sequences: \\\"s\\\\tp\\\\na\\\\0m\\\"\\n* Raw strings: r\\\"C:\\\\new\\\\test.spm\\\"\\n* Bytes literals in 3.X and 2.6+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): b'sp\\\\x01am'\\n* Unicode literals in 2.X and 3.3+ (see Chapter 4 , Chapter 37 ): u'eggs\\\\u0020spam'\\n\\nIn fact, 3.X defines str strings formally as sequences of Unicode code\\npoints, not bytes, to make this clear.

Because it can be a bit complex, it is perhaps best thought of as a combination of two steps:\\n1. Deletion. The slice you specify to the left of the = is deleted.\\n2. Insertion. The new items contained in the iterable object to the right of the = are inserted into the list on the left, at the place where the old slice was deleted.\\nNote, L[2:5]=L[3:6], for instance, works fine because the value to be inserted is fetched before the deletion\\nhappens on the left.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1]\\n>>> L[:0] = [2, 3, 4] # Insert all at :0, an empty slice at front\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1]\\n>>> L[len(L):] = [5, 6, 7] # Insert all at len(L):, an empty slice at end\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7]\\n>>> L.extend([8, 9, 10]) # Insert all at end, named method\\n>>> L\\n[2, 3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\n\\t\\nThe effect of `L.append(X)` is similar to `L+[X]`, but while the former changes L in place, the latter makes a new list.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, this has changed: magnitude comparison of mixed types\\nraises an exception instead of falling back on the fixed cross-type ordering.\\n\\nL.sort() vs. sorted\\nbuilt-in tools: reversed\\n\\nLike lists, dictionaries store object references (not copies, unless you ask for them explicitly)\\n\\n![Table 8-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-20.png)\\n\\nkeys in 3.X returns an iterable object, instead of a physical list\\nUnlike lists, however, whenever you assign a new dictionary key (one that hasn’t been assigned before) you create a new entry in the dictionary.\\n\\nIn 3.X the dictionary keys , values , and items methods all return view objects , whereas in 2.X they return actual result lists. \\nBesides being iterable, dictionary views also retain the original order of dictionary components, reflect future changes to the dictionary, and may support set operations. Unlike 2.X’s list results, though, dictionary views in 3.X are not carved in stone when created—they dynamically reflect future changes made to the dictionary after the view object has been created:\\n\\n In set operations, views may be mixed with other views, sets, and dictionaries; dictionaries\\nare treated the same as their keys views in this context:\\n```\\n>>> D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}\\n>>> D.keys() & D.keys() # Intersect keys views\\n{'b', 'c', 'a'}\\n>>> D.keys() & {'b'} # Intersect keys and set\\n{'b'}\\n>>> D.\\n```\\n\\n```\\n>>> Ks.sort()\\nAttributeError: 'dict_keys' object has no attribute 'sort'\\n```\\nTo work around this, in 3.X you must either convert to a list manually or use the\\nsorted call (introduced in Chapter 4 and covered in this chapter) on either a keys view\\nor the dictionary itself:\\n\\nOrderedDict\\n\\n## Tuples, files and everything else\\n![]($resource/2018-09-03-16-36-56.png)\\n![Table 9-1]($resource/2018-09-03-12-18-57.png)\\n\\nAs you can see, named tuples are a tuple/class/dictionary hybrid\\n (In short, named tuples build new classes that extend the tuple type, inserting a property accessor method for each named field that maps the name to its position)\\n \\n![Table 9-2]($resource/2018-09-03-12-03-26.png)\\n\\nEmpty lines in the file come back as strings containing just a newline character, not as empty strings.\\n```\\n>>> myfile.readline() # Empty string: end-of-file\\n''\\n```\\n\\t\\n* Text files represent content as normal str strings, perform Unicode encoding and decoding automatically, and perform end-of-line translation by default.\\n* Binary files represent content as a special bytes string type and allow programs to access file content unaltered.\\n\\npickle, shelve, json, struct\\n\\n In fact, when nested objects are present, Python automatically\\ntraverses data structures to apply comparisons from left to right, and as deeply as\\nneeded.\\n\\n More specifically, Python compares types as follows:\\n- Numbers are compared by relative magnitude, after conversion to the common highest type if needed.\\n- Strings are compared lexicographically (by the character set code point values returned by `ord` ), and character by character until the end or first mismatch (\\\"abc\\\"< \\\"ac\\\" ).\\n- Lists and tuples are compared by comparing each component from left to right, and recursively for nested structures, until the end or first mismatch ([2] > [1, 2] ).\\n- Sets are equal if both contain the same items (formally, if each is a subset of the other), and set relative magnitude comparisons apply subset and superset tests.\\n- Dictionaries compare as equal if their sorted (key, value) lists are equal. Relative magnitude comparisons are not supported for dictionaries in Python 3.X, but they work in 2.X as though comparing sorted (key, value) lists.\\n- Nonnumeric mixed-type magnitude comparisons (e.g., 1 < 'spam' ) are errors in Python 3.X. They are allowed in Python 2.X, but use a fixed but arbitrary ordering rule based on type name string. By proxy, this also applies to sorts, which use comparisons internally: nonnumeric mixed-type collections cannot be sorted in 3.X.\\n\\nPython 3.X disallows mixed-type magnitude testing, except numeric types.\\n\\nMore generally, the notions of true and false are intrinsic properties of every object in Python—each object is either true or false, as follows:\\n- Numbers are false if zero, and true otherwise.\\n- Other objects are false if empty, and true otherwise.\\n\\n That is, *None* is something, not nothing (despite its name!)—it is a real object and a real piece of memory that is created and given a built-in name by Python itself.\\n\\n In fact, even types themselves are an object type in Python.\\n Calls to these names are really object constructor calls, not simply conversion functions, though you can treat them as simple functions for basic usage.\\n\\nFor classic classes in Python 2.X, all class instances are instead of the type “instance,” and we must compare instance `__class__` attributes to compare their types meaningfully.\\n\\nRepetition Adds One Level Deep\\n```python\\n>>> L = [4, 5, 6]\\n>>> X = L * 4 # Like [4, 5, 6] + [4, 5, 6] + ...\\n>>> Y = [L] * 4 # [L] + [L] + ... = [L, L,...]\\n```\\n\\t\\nIf you remember that repetition, concatenation, and slicing copy only the top level of their operand objects, these sorts of cases make much more sense\\n\\nBeware of Cyclic Data Structure\\n```python\\n>>> L = ['grail'] # Append reference to same object\\n>>> L.append(L) # Generates cycle in object: [...]\\n>>> L\\n['grail', [...]]\\n```\\n\\n# Statements and Syntax\\n## Assignments, Expressions, and Prints\\n- Assignments create object references. (i.e. link a name with an object) They always create references to objects instead of copying the objects.\\n- Names are created when first assigned.\\n- Names must be assigned before referenced.\\n\\nModule imports, function and class definitions, for loop variables, and function arguments are all implicit assignments.\\n\\n![Table 11-1]($resource/2018-09-03-13-40-51.png)\\n\\nsequence assignment—any sequence of names can be\\nassigned to any sequence of values, and Python assigns the items one at a time by position. In fact, the original tuple and list assignment forms in Python have been generalized to accept any type of sequence (really, iterable) on the right as long as it is of the same length as the sequence on the left.\\n\\nMultiple-target assignment: Python assigns a reference to the same object (the object farthest to the right) to all the targets on the left.\\n\\nIn tuple/list assignment, Python creates a temporary tuple that saves the original values of the variables on the right before assigning.\\n\\nwe can even assign nested sequences, and Python unpacks their parts according to their shape, as expected. The sequence-nesting shape of the object on the left must match that of the object on the right.\\n> This nested tuple (really, sequence) unpacking\\nassignment form works for function argument lists in Python 2.X (though not in 3.X)\\n\\nIn short, a single starred name, *X, can be used in the assignment target in order to specify a more general matching against the sequence—the starred name is assigned a list, which collects all items in the sequence not assigned to other names. In fact, the starred name can appear anywhere in the target.\\n> This is similar in spirit to slicing, but not exactly the same—a sequence unpacking assignment always returns a list for multiple matched items, whereas slicing returns a sequence of the same type as the object sliced\\n```\\n>>> a, *b = 'spam'\\n>>> a, b\\n('s', ['p', 'a', 'm'])\\n>>> S[0], S[1:] # Slices are type-specific, * assignment always returns a list\\n('s', 'pam')\\n```\\n\\nFinally, errors can still be triggered if there is more than one starred name, if there are too few values and no star (as before), and if the starred name is not itself coded inside a sequence:\\n```\\n>>> *a = seq\\nSyntaxError: starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple\\n```\\n\\nFor augmented assignments, inplace operations may be applied for mutable objects as an optimization.\\n```\\n>>> L = [1, 2]\\n>>> L = L + [3] # Concatenate: slower\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3]\\n>>> L.append(4) # Faster, but in place\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4]\\n>>> L += [9, 10] # Mapped to L.extend([9, 10])\\n>>> L\\n[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\\n```\\nNote however, that because of this equivalence += for a list is not exactly the same as a + and = in all cases—for lists += allows arbitrary sequences (just like extend), but concatenation normally does not:\\n```\\n>>> L = []\\n>>> L += 'spam' # += and extend allow any sequence, but + does not!\\n>>> L\\n['s', 'p', 'a', 'm']\\n>>> L = L + 'spam'\\nTypeError: can only concatenate list (not \\\"str\\\") to list\\n```\\n> Although Python now supports statements like X += Y, it still does not\\nhave C’s auto-increment/decrement operators (e.g., X++, −−X).\\n\\n### Naming\\nFor portability, case also matters in the names of imported module files, even on platforms where the filesystems are case-insensitive.\\n\\nTrue, False, and None, are somewhat unusual in meaning—they also appear in the built-in scope of Python described in Chapter 17, and they are technically names assigned to objects.\\n\\nNames that begin with a single underscore (_X) are not imported by a from module import * statement\\n\\nNames that begin with two underscores and do not end with two more (__X) are localized (“mangled”) to enclosing classes.\\n\\n### Expression Statements\\nIn Python, you can use an expression as a statement, too. Expressions are commonly used as statements in two situations:\\n- For calls to functions and methods\\n- For printing values at the interactive prompt\\n\\nA statement that is not an expression must generally appear on a line all by itself, not nested in a larger syntactic structure. For example, Python doesn’t allow you to embed assignment statements (=) in other expressions. Besides, C assignments return the value assigned, but Python assignments are just statements, not expressions.\\n\\nExpression statements are often used to run list methods that change a list in place:\\n```\\n>>> L = L.append(4) # But append returns None, not L\\n>>> print(L) # So we lose our list!\\nNone\\n```\\n\\nNormally, whether printed output is buffered in memory or not is determined by file; passing a true value to flush forcibly flushes the stream.\\n\\nBecause the print statement just sends text to the sys.stdout.write method, you can capture printed text in your programs by assigning sys.stdout to an object whose write method processes the text in arbitrary ways\\n\\n## if Tests and Syntax Rules\\nThere is no switch or case statement in Python\\n\\n* Block and statement boundaries are detected automatically.\\n* Compound statements = header + “:” + indented statements. \\n* Blank lines, spaces, and comments are usually ignored.\\n* Docstrings are ignored but are saved and displayed by tools.\\n\\nStatements may span multiple lines if you’re continuing an open syntactic\\npair.\\n\\nBoolean operators stop evaluating (“short circuit”) as soon as a result is known. Boolean **and** and **or** operators return a true or false object in Python, not the values True or False\\n\\nFor `A = Y if X else Z`, Python runs expression Y only if X turns out to be true, and runs expression Z only if X turns out to be false.\\n\\nWhen defining classes, we can specify their Boolean nature with either the\\n__bool__ or __len__ methods.\\n\\n\\n\\n## while and for Loops\\nThe optional **else** block run if didn't exit loop with **break**\\n\\nPython doesn’t have what some languages call a “do until” loop statement. Python has no \\\"go to\\\" statement.\\n\\nPython 3.X (but not 2.X) allows ellipses coded as ... (literally, three consecutive dots) to appear any place an expression can. Because ellipses do nothing by themselves, this can serve as an alternative to the pass statement,\\n```\\n>>> X = ... # Alternative to None\\n>>> X\\nEllipsis\\n```\\n\\nAfter the **for** loop, this loop variable normally still refers to the last item visited, which is the last item in the sequence unless the loop exits with a break statement.\\n\\nEven nested structures may be automatically unpacked this way in a for:\\n```\\n>>> for ((a, b), c) in [((1, 2), 3), ((4, 5), 6)]: print(a, b, c)\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, as a general rule, you should resist the temptation to count things in Python—its iteration tools automate much of the work you do to loop over collections in lower-level languages like C.\\n\\nbuilt-in tools: range, zip, enumerate\\n\\nThe zip function is more general than this example suggests. For instance,\\nit accepts any type of sequence (really, any iterable object, including files), and it accepts more than two arguments. Moreover, zip truncates result tuples at the length of the shortest sequence when the argument lengths differ.\\n\\n## Iterations and Comprehensions\\n* Iterator vs. Iterable vs. Iteration tool/context\\n* Single scan vs. multiple scan\\n\\nIn some cases these two objects are the same when only a single scan is supported (e.g., files), and the iterator object is often temporary, used internally by the iteration tool. Moreover, some objects are both an iteration context tool (they iterate) and an iterable object (their results are iterable)—including Chapter 20’s generator expressions, and map and zip in Python 3.X.\\n\\nWhen the for loop begins, it first obtains an iterator from the iterable object by passing it to the iter built-in function; the object returned by iter in turn has the required next method. The iter function internally runs the __iter__ method, much like `next` and `__next__`.\\n\\nFor comprehensions, their full syntax allows for any number of **for** clauses, each of which can have an optional associated **if** clause.\\n\\nKeep in mind, though, that every built-in tool that scans from left to right across objects uses the iteration protocol.\\n\\nNotice that, unlike map and others, sorted returns an actual list in Python 3.X\\ninstead of an iterable.\\n\\nOne of the fundamental distinctions of Python 3.X is its stronger emphasis on iterators than 2.X. This, along with its Unicode model and mandated new-style classes, is one of 3.X’s most sweeping changes.\\n\\nUnlike **range**, **map**, **zip**, **filter** are their own iterators—after you step through their results once, they are exhausted.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X the dictionary keys, values, and items methods return iterable view objects that generate result items one at a time.\\n\\n## Documentation Interlude\\nThe PyDoc system covered here can render a module’s internal documentation as either plain text in a shell, or HTML in a web browser.\\n\\nThe **help** function: press the space bar to move to the next page, Enter to go to the next line, and Q to quit:\\n\\nSphinx\\n\\n# Functions and Generators\\n## Function Basics\\n* *def* is executable code. it’s legal (and even occasionally useful) to nest def statements inside if statements, while loops, and even other *def*s.\\n* *def* creates an object and assigns it to a name. Function objects may also have arbitrary user-defined *attributes* attached to them to record data.\\n\\nNames are always looked up in *scopes*—places where variables are stored— and assignments bind names to scopes.\\n\\n>Files must generally be rewound (e.g., with a file.seek(0) or another\\nopen) after they have been read to end-of-file once, and so are single-pass iterators\\n\\n## Scopes\\nWhen we talk about the search for a name’s value in relation to code, the term\\nscope refers to a namespace: that is, the location of a name’s assignment in your source\\ncode determines the scope of the name’s visibility to your code.\\n\\nBy default, all names assigned inside a function are associated with that function’s namespace, and no other.\\n\\nLexical scoping:\\n- If a variable is assigned inside a def, it is local to that function.\\n- If a variable is assigned in an enclosing def, it is nonlocal to nested functions.\\n- If a variable is assigned outside all defs, it is global to the entire file.\\n\\nEach module is a global scope, the global scope spans a single file only.\\n* Assigned names are local unless declared global or nonlocal\\n* All other names are enclosing function locals, globals, or built-ins.\\n* Each call to a function creates a new local scope.\\n\\n> Note `L=X` within a function will classify L as a local, but L.append(X) will not.\\n\\n### Name Resolution: The LEGB Rule\\n- Name assignments create or change local names by default.\\n- Name references search at most four scopes: local, then enclosing functions (if any), then global, then built-in.\\n- Names declared in global and nonlocal statements map assigned names to enclosing module and function scopes, respectively.\\n\\nNote that the second scope lookup layer, E—the scopes of enclosing defs or lambdas—can technically correspond to more than one lookup level.\\n\\nAlso keep in mind that these rules apply only to simple variable names (e.g., spam). Qualified attribute names (e.g., object.spam) live in particular objects and follow a completely different set of lookup rules than those covered here.\\n\\nThere are technically three more scopes in Python—temporary loop variables in some comprehensions, exception reference variables in some try handlers, and local scopes in class statements\\n\\nIn 3.X, the loop variables are local to the expression itself in all comprehension forms: generator, list, set, and dictionary. In 2.X, they are local to generator expressions and set and dictionary compressions, but not to list comprehensions that map their names to the scope outside the expression. By contrast, for loop statements never localize their variables to the statement block in any Python.\\n\\nIn 3.X, exception reference variables are local to that except block, and in fact are removed when the block is exited (even if you’ve used it earlier in your code!).\\n\\nAlthough the LEGB rule is used to resolve\\nnames used in both the top level of a class itself as well as the top level of method functions nested within it, classes themselves are skipped by scope lookups—their names must be fetched as object attributes.\\n\\n### The global/nonlocal Statement\\nThe global statement consists of the keyword global, followed by one or more names separated by commas. All the listed names will be mapped to the enclosing module’s scope when assigned or referenced within the function body. \\n```\\nglobal x\\n```\\n\\nThe name x do not need even exist in the enclosing module\\nbefore the function runs; in this case, the first assignment in the function creates x in the module.\\n\\nIf, on the other hand, X is declared nonlocal within the function in 3.X (only), the assignment changes the name X in the closest enclosing function’s local scope. The name X must have been defined in at least one enclosing function.\\n\\n```\\ndef f1():\\nx = 88\\ndef f2(x=x): # Remember enclosing scope X with defaults\\nprint(x)\\nf2()\\nf1() # Prints 88\\n```\\nBecause the second x is evaluated before Python steps into the nested def, it still refers to the x in f1.\\n```\\ndef func():\\nx = 4\\naction = (lambda n, x=x: x ** n) # Pass x in manually\\nreturn action\\n```\\nLoop variables may require defaults, not scopes, Compare\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Tries to remember each i\\nacts.append(lambda x: i ** x) # But all remember same last i!\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nwith\\n```\\n>>> def makeActions():\\nacts = []\\nfor i in range(5): # Use defaults instead\\nacts.append(lambda x, i=i: i ** x) # Remember current i\\nreturn acts\\n```\\nBecause defaults are implemented as single objects attached to functions, mutable defaults retain state from call to call, rather than being initialized anew on each call.\\n\\nUnlike global, nonlocal names must already exist in the enclosing function’s scope when declared. In fact, they are checked at function definition time before either an enclosing or nested function is called.\\n\\nNonlocal both allows assignment to names in enclosing function scopes and limits scope lookups for such names to enclosing defs.\\n\\nPython uses naming conventions in both 2.X and 3.X that ensure that the arbitrary names you assign as function attributes won’t clash with names related to internal implementation.\\n\\nTo summarize: globals, nonlocals, classes, and function attributes all offer changeable state-retention options.\\n\\n## Arguments\\nIn Python 2.X, it’s also possible to automatically unpack tuples in arguments passed to a function.\\n```\\ndef f((a,(b,c)))\\n```\\nThis def syntax is no longer supported in Python 3.X. Instead, code this function as:\\n```\\ndef f(T): (a, (b, c)) = T\\n```\\nTuple unpacking argument syntax is also disallowed by 3.X in lambda\\nfunction argument lists. Somewhat asymmetrically, tuple unpacking assignment is still automatic in 3.X for loops targets\\n\\nBy default, arguments are matched by position, from left to right, and you must pass exactly as many arguments as there are argument names in the function header.\\n\\n![Table 18-1]($resource/2018-09-04-20-04-02.png)\\n\\nIn a function call, arguments must appear in this order: any positional arguments or the *iterable form, followed by any keyword arguments or the **dict form. If we see *iterable and **dict as being unpacked to positional arguments and keyword arguments, the order becomes: any positional arguments, followed by any keyword arguments. In a broad sense, there are only two arguments: positional and keyword.\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b,c,d,e,f,g):\\n print('ok')\\nb=[2]\\nx = {'d':4,'e':5}\\ny = {'f':6}\\nfoo(1,*b,3,**x,g=7,**y) //ok\\n```\\n> In a function header, we use the term \\\"parameter\\\" instead of \\\"argument\\\"\\n\\nIn a function header, parameters must appear in this order: any normal parameter(name); followed by any default parameters (name=value); followed by the *name (or \\\\* in 3.X) form; followed by any name or name=value keyword-only arguments (in 3.X); followed by the **name form\\n\\nWe can use a * character by itself in the arguments list to indicate that a function does not accept a variable-length argument list but still expects all arguments following the * to be passed as keywords.\\n\\nThe *name=value* form has two meaning:\\n- before the form *name, it's positional with default value\\n- after the form *name, it's keyword-only with default value\\n\\nThere can be at most one *name parameter, which collects all remaining positional arguments (including those in *iterabe). Similarly, There can be at most one *\\\\*dict parameter, which collects all remaining keyword arguments (including those in *\\\\*dict arguments).\\n\\n```\\ndef foo(a,b=3,*c,d,**e):\\n print(b,e)\\nx = [3,4]\\ny = {'d':5,'e':6,'f':7}\\nfoo(1,2,*x,**y) # 2 {'e': 6, 'f': 7}\\n```\\nThe steps that Python internally carries out to match arguments before\\nassignment can roughly be described as follows:\\n1. Assign nonkeyword arguments by position.\\n2. Assign keyword arguments by matching names.\\n3. Assign extra nonkeyword arguments to *name tuple.\\n4. Assign extra keyword arguments to **name dictionary.\\n5. Assign default values to unassigned arguments in header.\\n\\n> Note that in both function call and header, the *name = value* form are not assignments.\\n\\nThe default parameters are attached to function objects, if you code\\na default to be a mutable object (e.g., def f(a=[])), the same, single\\nmutable object is reused every time the function is later called—even if\\nit is changed in place within the function.\\n\\nBelow is a tracer function example:\\n```\\ndef tracer(func, *pargs, **kargs): # Accept arbitrary arguments\\n print('calling:', func.__name__)\\n return func(*pargs, **kargs) # Pass along arbitrary arguments\\n```\\n\\n## Advanced Function Topics\\nIn fact, recursion is not used nearly as often in Python as in\\nmore esoteric languages like Prolog or Lisp, because Python emphasizes simpler procedural statements like loops, which are usually more natural.\\n\\nOn the other hand, recursion—or equivalent explicit stack-based algorithms we’ll meet shortly—can be required to traverse arbitrarily shaped structures.\\n\\nAlso note that standard Python limits the depth of its runtime call stack—crucial to recursive call programs—to trap infinite recursion errors. To expand it, use the **sys** module:\\n```\\n>>> sys.getrecursionlimit() # 1000 calls deep default\\n1000\\n>>> sys.setrecursionlimit(10000) # Allow deeper nesting\\n>>> help(sys.setrecursionlimit) # Read more about it\\n```\\n\\n### Function attributes and annotations\\n```\\n>>> func.__code__\\n>>> func.__code__.co_varnames\\n```\\nPython’s own implementation-related data stored on functions follows naming conventions that prevent them from clashing with the more arbitrary attribute names you might assign yourself. In 3.X, all function internals’ names have leading and trailing double underscores (“_\\\\_X__”);\\n\\nAttributes are related to objects instead of scopes (and must be referenced through the function name within its code).\\n\\nPython provides special syntax for specifying annotations, but it doesn’t do anything with them itself; annotations are completely optional, and when present are simply attached to the function object’s __annotations__ attribute for use by other tools. Syntactically, function annotations are coded in def header lines, as arbitrary expressions associated with arguments and return values.\\n```\\n>>> def func(a: 'spam', b: (1, 10), c: float) -> int:\\nreturn a + b + c\\n>>> func(1, 2, 3)\\n6\\n>>> func.__annotations__\\n{'c': , 'b': (1, 10), 'a': 'spam', 'return': }\\n```\\n\\nFinally, note that annotations work only in def statements, not lambda expressions.\\n\\n- **lambda** is an expression, not a statement.\\n- lambda’s body is a single expression, not a block of statements.\\n- Defaults work on lambda arguments, just like in a def.\\n- The code in a lambda body also follows the same scope lookup rules as code inside a def. lambda expressions introduce a local scope much like a nested def, which automatically sees names in enclosing functions, the module, and the built-in scope (via the LEGB rule)\\n\\n```\\n>>> ((lambda x: (lambda y: x + y))(99))(4)\\n103\\n```\\n\\nuseful library: functools, operator\\n\\n## Comprehensions and Generations\\nmap calls can be twice as fast as equivalent for loops, and list comprehensions are often faster than map calls.\\n\\nGenerator function vs. Generator vs. Generator expression\\n- *send* advances to the next item \\n- *yield* is now an expression form, it must be enclose in parentheses unless it's the only item on the right ride of the assignment statement.\\n- methods: *throw*, *close*\\n- *yield from*\\n\\nGenerator expressions may also run slightly slower than list comprehensions in practice, so they are probably best used only for very large result sets, or applications that cannot wait for full results generation.\\n\\nA subtle but important point: both generator functions and generator expressions are their own iterators and thus support just one active iteration.\\n\\nPython 3.X localizes loop variables in all four forms—temporary loop variable names in generator, set, dictionary, and list comprehensions are local to the expression.\\n\\nIn general, list comprehensions are usually the quickest of the bunch; map beats list comprehensions in Python only when all tools must call functions; for loops tend to be slower than comprehensions; and generator functions and expressions are slower than comprehensions by a constant factor. Under\\n\\n## The benchmarking Interlude\\nTimeing modules: time, timer, profile, timeit, pystone.py\\n\\n# Part V. Modules and Packages\\nModules are processed with two statements and one important function:\\n- import: Lets a client (importer) fetch a module as a whole\\n- from: Allows clients to fetch particular names from a module\\n- imp.reload (reload in 2.X): Provides a way to reload a module’s code without stopping Python\\n\\nIn Python, cross-file module linking is not resolved until such import statements are executed at runtime; their net effect is to assign module names—simple variables like b—to loaded module objects. In fact, the module name used in an import statement serves two purposes: it identifies the external file to be loaded, but it also becomes a variable assigned to the loaded module.\\n\\nSimilarly, objects defined by a module are also created at runtime, as the import is executing: import literally runs statements in the target file one at a time to create its contents.\\n\\nIn python, imports perform three distinct steps the first time a program imports a given file:\\n1. Find the module’s file.\\n2. Compile it to byte code (if needed).\\n3. Run the module’s code to build the objects it defines.\\n\\nBear in mind that all three of these steps are carried out only the first time a module is imported during a program’s execution; later imports of the same module in a program run bypass all of these steps and simply fetch the already loaded module object in memory. Technically, Python does this by storing loaded modules in a table named **sys.mod** ules and checking there at the start of an import operation. If the module is not present, a three-step process begins. (see **imp.reload**)\\n> Python keeps already imported modules in the built-in **sys.modules** dictionary so it can keep track of what’s been loaded.\\n\\nNotice that compilation happens when a file is being imported. Because of this, you will not usually see a .pyc byte code file for the top-level file of your program, unless it is also imported elsewhere—only imported files leave behind .pyc files on your machine.\\n\\n### The Module Search Path\\nRoughly, Python’s module search path is composed of the concatenation of these major components, some of which are preset for you and some of which you can tailor to tell Python where to look:\\n1. The home directory of the program (subdirectories not included)\\n2. PYTHONPATH directories (if set)\\n3. Standard library directories\\n4. The contents of any .pth files (if present)\\n5. The site-packages home of third-party extensions\\n\\nUltimately, the concatenation of these four components becomes **sys.path**, a mutable list of directory. The first and\\nthird elements of the search path are defined automatically. Because Python searches the concatenation of these components from first to last, though, the second and fourth elements can be used to extend the path to include your own source code directories.\\n\\nBy modifying the sys.path list, you can modify the search path for all future imports made in a program’s run. Such changes last only for the duration of the script, however; PYTHONPATH and .pth files offer more permanent ways to modify the path—the first per user, and the second per installation.\\n\\nPython automatically selects any type that matches a module’s name. For same names with different extensions, Python follows a standard picking order, though this order is not guaranteed to stay the same over time or across implementations. \\n\\nBy using import hooks, archived files are automatically extracted at import time when a .zip file is selected from the module import search path.\\n\\nFor details, see the builtin **importlib._\\\\_import__** function\\n\\nThird-party extensions for Python typically use the **distutils** tools in the standard library to automatically install themselves, so no path configuration is required to use their code.\\n\\nSystems that use distutils generally come with a setup.py script, which is run to install them; this script imports and uses distutils modules to place such systems in a directory that is automatically part of the module search path (usually in the Lib\\\\site-packages subdirectory of the Python install tree, wherever that resides on the target machine).\\n\\n## Module Coding Basics\\n### Module Filenames\\nThe .py is technically optional for top-level files that will be run but not imported.\\n\\nIn fact, both the names of module files and the names of directories used in\\npackage imports (discussed in the next chapter) must conform to the rules for variable names presented.\\n\\n**import** fetches the module as a whole, so you\\nmust qualify to fetch its names; in contrast, **from** fetches (or copies) specific names out of the module.\\n\\nIn Python 3.X, the from ...* statement form described here can be used\\nonly at the top level of a module file, not within a function.\\n\\nJust like def, import and from are executable statements, not compile-time declarations. They may be nested in if tests, to select among options; appear in function defs, to be loaded only on calls (subject to the preceding note); be used in try statements, to provide defaults; and so on.\\n```\\n>>> from small import x, y # Copy two names out\\n>>> x = 42 # Changes local x only\\n>>> y[0] = 42 # Changes shared mutable in place\\n```\\n\\nAt least conceptually, a from statement like this one:\\n```\\nfrom module import name1, name2 # Copy these two names out (only)\\n```\\nis equivalent to this statement sequence:\\n\\n```\\nimport module # Fetch the module object\\nname1 = module.name1 # Copy names out by assignment\\nname2 = module.name2\\ndel module # Get rid of the module name\\n```\\n\\nThe **from** always imports the entire module into memory if it has not yet been imported, regardless of how many names it copies out of the file. There is no way to load just part of a module file.\\n\\nMoreover, the from module import * form really can corrupt namespaces and make names difficult to understand, especially when applied to more than one file.\\n\\nProbably the best real-world advice here is to generally prefer import to from for simple modules, to explicitly list the variables you want in most from statements, and to limit the from * form to just one import per file.\\n\\nThe **as** extension works in both import and from as a simple renaming tool.\\n\\nIn fact, internally, module namespaces are stored as dictionary objects.\\n\\nThe LEGB scope rule applies only to bare, unqualified names—it may be used for the leftmost name in a name path, but later names after dots search specific objects instead.\\n\\nlexical scoping notion—in Python, the scopes surrounding\\na piece of code are completely determined by the code’s physical position in your file. Scopes are never influenced by function calls or module imports.\\n\\nimport operations never give upward visibility to code in imported files\\n—an imported file cannot see names in the importing file. In some sense, although imports do not nest namespaces upward, they do nest downward.\\n```\\nprint(mod2.mod3.X) # Nested mod3's X\\n```\\n\\n### Reloading Modules\\nThe **reload** function forces an already loaded module’s code to be reloaded and rerun. Assignments in the file’s new code change the existing module object in place.\\n\\n> Note that reload currently only works on modules\\nwritten in Python;\\n\\nBecause reload expects an object, a module must have been previously imported successfully before you can reload it.\\n\\nWhen you call reload, Python rereads the module file’s source code and reruns its toplevel statements. Perhaps the most important thing to know about reload is that it changes a module object in place; it does not delete and re-create the module object.\\n- Reloads impact all clients that use **import** to fetch modules\\n- Reloads impact future from clients only. Clients that used from to fetch attributes in the past won’t be affected by a reload; they’ll still have references to the old objects fetched before the reload.\\n- Reloads apply to a single module only. You must run them on each module you wish to update, unless you use code or tools that apply reloads transitively.\\n\\n## Module Packages\\nDotted package \\n**from package import item**: the item can be either a submodule (or subpackage) of the package, or some other name defined in the package, like a function, class or variable.\\n**import item.subitem.subitem**: each item except for the last must be a package; the last item can be a module or a package but can't be a class or function or variable defined in the previous item.\\n\\nTow kinds of imports:\\n- absolute imports\\n- relative imports\\n\\nIn sum, Python imports select between relative (in the containing directory) and absolute (in a directory on sys.path) resolutions as follows:\\n- Dotted imports: from . import m \\nAre relative-only in both 2.X and 3.X\\n- Nondotted imports: import m, from m import x \\nAre relative-then-absolute in 2.X, and absolute-only in 3.X\\n\\nNote that relative imports are based on the name of the current module. Since the name of the main module is always \\\"__main__\\\", modules intended for use as the main module of a Python application must always use absolute imports.\\n\\nPython 3.3 adds another flavor to modules: *namespace packages*.\\n\\nPackages are just a special kind of module. Specifically, any module that contains a `__path__` attribute is considered a package.\\n\\nTwo kinds of packages:\\n* regular packages\\n* namespace packages\",[[1566089846661,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,670,\"\\n\"]],[669,669],[670,670]]],[1566089849019,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[1,670,\"jdkskjl\"]],[670,670],[677,677]]],[1566089850622,[\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\",[[-1,670,\"jdkskjl\"]],[677,677],[670,670]]]],null,\"yonggu@yongs-MacBook-Air.local\"]]}"}],"posts":[]}
